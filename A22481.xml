            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Doctrine of the Popiſh School-men alloweth in their deciding of caſes of conſcience, ſuch as are vniuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wrongfully impriſoned, to eſcape for their liues if they can: and according to this determination, is the practiſe of the Papiſts.

The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> warneth Seruants to bee ſubiect to their Maiſters with all feare; not onely to the good and courteous, but alſo to ſuch as are froward: and he giueth this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <note n="t" place="margin">1 Pet. 2, 19.</note>

            <p>Theſe thinges heere briefly touched, are largely intreated of in this <hi>Commentarie;</hi> touching the penning whereof, to leaue mine owne Labors to the Iudgement of the indifferent Reader, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny (but doo ingenuouſly confeſſe) that I haue benefited my ſelfe, and do deſire to benefit others, by other Authors, both Olde and New, whom I haue ſearched and peruſed, through whoſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes I haue bin guided and directed in the way, and by whoſe eyes I haue ſeene into many particulers heere diſcuſſed.

            <p>This Expoſition (ſuch as it is) I preſume to offer vnto your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, not fearing your Iudgement in the allowance, nor doubting of your fauour in the acceptance thereof, and therefore grounding my ſelfe vpon it, I regard not the cenſure of Carpers and Cauillers, who haue nothing to grace themſelues, but by ſeeking the diſgrace of others; nor yet any thing to raiſe themſelues a great name, but by taking away others good name: ſo that as one ſaith well, <note n="d" place="margin">

            <p>Wherefore, leauing theſe raſh and rigorous Cenſors of other mens doings, I come to declare the cauſes that haue induced me to offer the expoſition of this Epiſtle vnto you, and to paſſe it vnder your Worſhips name. For to whom doth a Treatiſe of Godlineſſe more fitly agree, then to him that profeſſeth Godlineſſe, and hath the power of it dwelling in his heart? Or to whom ſhould I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Patronage of the truth, better then to him that is a fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and louer of the truth, and of ſuch as fauour and loue the trueth? Beſides, as I haue heeretofore taſted of your kindneſſe and bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe toward me, which I euer eſteemed as a debt lying vpon me,
<pb facs="tcp:7222:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſo I haue beene deſirous to leaue a perpetuall Teſtimony to others, of a thankefull heart. I am not able to recompence like for like, but may rather ſay with the Apoſtle, <note n="g" place="margin">Acts 3, 6.</note> 
               <hi>Siluer and Gold haue I none, but ſuch as I haue I giue vnto you:</hi> and ſo much the more I will alwaies be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to follow the example of <hi>Paul,</hi> who when he had receiued mercy at the hands of <hi>Oneſiphorus,</hi> he praied vnto God to render backe into his boſom the fruits of his loue beſtowed vpon him, <note n="h" place="margin">2 Tim. 1, 16 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord ſhew mercy vnto the houſe of Oneſiphorus, for he oft refreſhed me, and was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of my chaine: but when he was at Rome, he ſought me out very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, &amp; found me. The Lord grant vnto him, that he may find mercy with the Lord at that day, &amp;c.</hi> So my erneſt prayer to God, euen the Father of all mercy, and God of al conſolation, is, &amp; euer ſhal be, to ſhew mercy for your mercy, &amp; loue for your loue, &amp; to preſerue you vnto his heauenly kingdom. And I beſeech you oftentimes to Meditate vpon the 71. Pſalme, which as it was compoſed by the Prophet in his latter time, ſo he oftentimes craueth of God to be with him, &amp; to keepe him ſafe, now that his head was hoare, and his haires gray, <note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 71, 5, 9, 17, 18.</note>

Thus doth the Wiſe-man deſcribe the diſcommodities and difficulties of old age, which approacheth vnto vs all, and will in the end ouertake vs, to the end we ſhould learne to remember our Creator in the dayes of our youth.

Among all which, this is to be obſerued, that ſuch as did admit (as Diuine) any of the Epiſtles, did neuer deny the authoritie of this Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon.</hi> Some indeed haue renounced the Epiſtle to the Hebrues: ſome, the latter Epiſtle of <hi>Peter:</hi> ſome, the Epiſtle of <hi>Iames:</hi> ſome, the Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus;</hi> and other, the two latter familiar Epiſtles of <hi>Iohn:</hi> but no Hereticke was ſo forſaken of God, or euer grew to be ſo deſperate, to contemne and ſet light by this Epiſtle, if euer he admitted and accepted the credit of any. Which plainly declareth the Maieſty that ſhineth in this little and ſhort Letter, wherein <hi>Paule</hi> by his Diuine eloquence and pithineſſe of argument, doeth euen rauiſh and astoniſh all the Readers thereof.</p>
            <p>To the end this may the better appeare, let vs as in a Table ſet before our eyes <note n="n" place="margin" type="runSum">The contents and cheefe heads of this Epiſtle.</note> the chiefe heads and contents of this Epiſtle, and view with how cunning a penne or Penſill, the principall parts thereof are drawne, together with the profite ariſing from thence; following the example of them, which when they bidde any gueſſe to Dinner or Supper, are wont firſt to declare what ſhall be their cheare, &amp; how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Diſhes they ſhall haue, praying them to take it in good worth, and to looke for neither better nor worſe, then hath beene mentioned. In like manner, beeing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to make a feaſt, and hauing prouided a Banquet, which I haue ſet forth, and inuited the courteous &amp; Chriſtian Reader, that will come and taſt of it: I dare be bold to promiſe, that the Meate is good and wholeſome. What foode ſoeuer is found that cannot pleaſe the taſt of a well-affected ſtomacke, I confeſſe the fault is in the Cooke that hath prepared and dreſſed it. I would therefore entreat thee to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of theſe three Diſhes, and to conſider, the perſon that was the writer; the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to whom he writeth; and the perſon for whom he writeth. The perſon that penned it, was <hi>Paule</hi> the Apoſtle: the perſon to whom it was written, was <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> the Maister: the perſon for whom hee wrote, was <hi>Oneſimus</hi> the Seruant. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon theſe three, as on certaine pillers, ſtand the maine drift and purpoſe of this whole Epiſtle heere expounded.</p>
            <p>Touching the firſt, <note n="o" place="margin" type="runSum">The perſon of the Writer of the Epiſtle.</note> which is <hi>Paul</hi> the Writer, he doth not ſtile himſelf in this place, as commonly he vſeth; <hi>An Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>The Priſoner of Chriſt,</hi> and declareth that he begat <hi>Oneſimus</hi> to the Faith, in Priſon. It is honourable to the Saintes to ſuffer for the truthes ſake. The Apoſtles reioyced that they were <note n="p" place="margin">Actes 5, 41. Iames 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>Counted worthy</hi> to endure afflictions and troubles in a good cauſe. They
<pb facs="tcp:7222:7" rendition="simple:additions"/> endured impriſonment as Martyrs, not as Malefactors; as Preachers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, <note n="r" place="margin">1 Pet. 1, 15</note> not <hi>As Buſie-bodies in other mens matters;</hi> as doers of good, not as euill doers; neuer ceaſing to further the ſaluation of others, euen when their bodies were reſtrained of libertie: and yet in this want of enlargement, they were mighty in deede and word, to worke the conuerſion of ſuch as reſorted vnto them, verifying the ſaying of the Apoſtle. 2. Tim. 2. 9. <note n="ſ" place="margin">2 Tim. 2, 9.</note> 
               <hi>I ſuffer trouble vnto bondes, but the word of God is not bound.</hi> Whiles he pleaded his cauſe in Chaines, <note n="t" place="margin">Actes 16, 28</note> hee had <hi>Almoſt</hi> caught <hi>Agrippa</hi> in the Chaine of the Gospell, and wonne him to the Faith. When he was come to <hi>Rome,</hi> he would not be idle, <note n="u" place="margin">Act. 28, 17, 23.</note> but <hi>called the chiefe of the Iewes together,</hi> and then expounded vnto them the way of Saluation, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying the Kingdome of God, and perſwading them thoſe thinges that concerne Ieſus, both out of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and out of the Prophets, from morning to night. Thus doth one ſay moſt truely of him; <hi>When he was bound, he was ſtronger then they that bound him:</hi> when he was a Captiue, he was freer then they that kept him: and when his Iudges examined him, he examined them, and ſet them at libertie that were vnder the thraldome of ſinne and Sathan. It is truely ſaid of the Wiſe-man; <note n="x" place="margin">Prou. 11, 30 Dan. 12, 3.</note> 
               <hi>He that winneth Soules is wiſe, and ſhall ſhine as the brightneſſe of the firmament, and ſuch as turne many to righteouſnes, ſhall ſhine as the Starres for euer and euer.</hi> This wiſedome is no where to be found, no where to be ſought, no where to be learned, but in the Word of GOD, which is the wiſedome of God, and the power of God. So then we ſee, it is not the puniſhment that maketh a Martyr, but the cauſe.

               <hi>Priſon, with the Butler and Baker of King Pharaoh:</hi> They ſuffered impriſonment in the ſame place, but the cauſe was not one for which they ſuffered. <hi>Ioſephs Maiſter tooke him and put him in Priſon, in the place where the kings Priſoners lay bound; and there he was in Priſon;</hi> but becauſe it was in a good cauſe, and for a good conſcience, <hi>the Lord was with him, and ſhewed him mercy, and got him fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour in the ſight of the Maiſter of the Priſon.</hi> The like we might ſay of <hi>Paule</hi> and <hi>Sylas,</hi> who were not onely beaten with Rods, but clapped vppe in cloſe Priſon with Malefactors; but they were not without comfort in their ſufferings, <note n="z" place="margin">Actes 16, 25</note> For <hi>At midnight they prayed and ſung Pſalmes vnto God, ſo that the reſt of the Priſoners heard them.</hi> They ſuffered <note n="a" place="margin">2 Tim. 2, 9.</note> 
               <hi>As euill doers,</hi> but not for euill doing. And albeit they were Priſoners, yet they were Christian Priſoners: and when the body was ready to be offered, and the time of their departure drew neere, forgat <note n="b" place="margin">

            <p>Touching the ſecond point, <note n="c" place="margin" type="runSum">The perſon to whom Paul writeth.</note> we are to conſider the perſon to whom Paule wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth; which is, to <hi>Philemon,</hi> crauing at his hands the fruit of Chriſtian Equitie and Moderation, to forgiue him that had offended him, according to the doctrine of the common Maiſter of them both, Ieſus Chriſt.

As Chriſt taught forgiueneſſe to others, ſo he practiſed his owne Doctrine, and <note n="f" place="margin">Luke 23, 34.</note> 
               <hi>prayed for thoſe that were his perſecuters. Philemon</hi> had bin greatly wronged by his falſe and theeuiſh ſeruant, yet <hi>Paul</hi> craueth pardon for him vpon his repentance toward God, and his ſubmiſſion toward his Maiſter.

<pb facs="tcp:7222:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> and to ſwallow vp them in deſpaire, whom they ought to raiſe vp with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. For they alledge, that Chriſt threatneth, <note n="k" place="margin">Math. 10, 33</note> 
               <hi>Whoſoeuer ſhall deny him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, them will he deny before his Father which is in heauen.</hi> But he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth ſuch as perſeuer in it without repentance, denying him vnto the end, and forſaking him vnto the death, ſuch indeede he will diſclaime and deny in the kingdome of his Father; which plainely appeareth by the contrary, in the oppoſite Member going before, <note n="l" place="margin">Math. 10, 32.</note> where he promiſeth, that <hi>Whoſoeuer ſhall confeſſe him before men, them will hee alſo confeſſe before his Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen;</hi> whereby hee meaneth ſuch as continue in that confeſſion, and are faithfull without ſtarting backward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter</hi> being in the High-prieſts houſe, did deny his Maiſter that choſe him, not only to bee an Apoſtle, but to bee an elect veſſell, to preach the Goſpell both to <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> he denied him that bought him, and redeemed him; in word, with an Oath, with Curſing and Execration; yet hee returned and repented: hee went out from that wicked Company, and wept for his greeuous fall most bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Many good Souldiers are ſometimes daunted at the ſight of their Enemies, and runne out of the Field like Cowards, not without ſome reproch and impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Man-hoode, who afterward gather ſtrength, and are aſhamed of their owne folly, both reſisting thoſe that fight against them moſt couragiouſly, and pleaſing the Captaine that hath made choiſe of them.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that the Lord proclaimeth Mercy, and reneweth his Couenant of forgiueneſſe to ſuch as turne vnto him. The Prophet <hi>Ioel</hi> ſaith, Chapter 2. <note n="m" place="margin">Ioel 2. 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>Turne you vnto mee with all your heart, with faſting, weeping, and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; Rent your hearts, and not your Garments, and turne vnto the Lorde your God, for he is gracious and mercifull, ſlow to anger, &amp; of great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and repenteth him of the euill.</hi> Heere is mercie offered, and a generall pardon publiſhed, which God will performe to all penitent perſons.

But what followeth? <hi>Say vnto them, as I liue ſaith the Lord, I deſire not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turne from his way, and liue: Turn you, turn you from your euil waies, for why will ye die, O ye houſe of</hi> Iſraell? When the ſinful woman came to Chriſt in the houſe of <hi>Simon</hi> the Phariſee, humbly confeſsing her ſins, &amp; ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding abundance of teares for them, and by them both, testifying her loue to Chriſt, he turned vnto her, and ſaid, <note n="o" place="margin">Luke 7, 48.</note>

To conclude this point, our Sauiour ſheweth, that when a man, hauing an hundred Sheepe, hath lost one of them, he leaueth ninety and nine in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and goeth after that which is gone astray, vntill he finde it, <note n="u" place="margin">Luke 15, 4, 7, 10.</note> and then <hi>Hee layeth it on his ſhoulders with ioy,</hi> and carrieth it home to the ſheepefold, <hi>I ſay vnto you, that ioy ſhall be in heauen, euen in the preſence of the Angelles of God, for one ſinner that conuerteth.</hi> Seeing then, the Lord Ieſus (who is the LORD of life) teacheth in the Goſpell, that there is ſo great ioy in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for a penitent ſinner, <note n="x" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cypri. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 12.</note> how great ioy ought there to be on earth, when wee ſee the kingdome of God enlarged, and a fellow member pulled out of the iawes of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, whom he had holden captiue, and taken as a prey to deuoure and deſtroy for euer? It is the end of Christs comming, <note n="y" place="margin">Luke 19, 10.</note> 
               <hi>To ſeeke and to ſaue that which was loſt,</hi> Luke 19, 10. And ſeeing our gracious God is ſo ready to remit offences done against him; who are we, and of what matter or mettall are we made, that are ſo hard-hearted, and ſtif-necked, and implacable againſt our Bretheren? Wee are taught to aske forgiueneſſe, <note n="z" place="margin">Math. 6, 11, and 18, 35.</note> 
               <hi>as we Forgiue:</hi> and in the Parable of the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and mercileſſe ſeruant propounded, <hi>Math.</hi> 18.

            <p>This Doctrine doth the Apoſtle publiſh at large in this Epiſtle, crauing pardon at the hands of <hi>Philemon,</hi> for his penitent and proſtrate ſeruant, not doubting but as God had forgiuen him, and giuen him repentance, ſo hee alſo for his part would remit the treſpaſſe and iniury done vnto himſelfe. Thus wee ſee what to iudge of theſe <hi>Nouatians,</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Aug. de hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſ. cap.</hi> 38.</note> who are indeede the true <hi>Puritans,</hi> and contrary to the whole courſe of the Scriptures, deny repentance and reconciliation, to ſuch men as after baptiſme (through infirmity, and force of perſecution, and feare of daunger) doe yeeld ſo farre, as to deny the faith. We haue a noble example of Gods notable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion toward ſuch as offend of frailty and weakneſſe in <hi>Peter,</hi> who was receiued to mercy: and Christ would neuer haue ſaide, <note n="b" place="margin">Math. 18, 18</note> 
               <hi>Whatſoeuer ye looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heauen,</hi> if ſuch perſons as repent were altogether to bee barred out of the boſom of the Church. Can theſe proud spirites then be the Diſciples of Chriſt, <note n="c" place="margin">

            <p>The third and last point remaineth. For, as we haue conſidered the perſon that writeth this Epistle, and the perſon to whom it is written, ſo we are <note n="d" place="margin">The perſon for whom this Epiſtle is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</note> to marke the perſon for whom it is written, to wit; for <hi>Oneſimus</hi> a ſeruant, a fugitiue ſeruant, a falſe ſeruant, a fraudulent ſeruant. A baſe and meane ſubiect for the Apoſtle to handle, howbeit penned in ſo high and heauenly a manner, and contriued with ſuch exquiſit Art, and excellent Iudgement, that it ouer-reacheth the meanneſſe of the matter, and leaueth no excuſe that <hi>Philemon</hi> could alledge to wind himſelf from him, and manifesteth the ſpeciall care that <hi>Paul</hi> had, of this poore penitent perſon. It is recorded of <note n="e" place="margin">In the works of Maiſter <hi>Greenham.</hi>
               </note> M. <hi>Fox</hi> of bleſſed Memory, when one told him that a certain man (of none of the greatest or highest callings) who had receiued much comfort from him in the dayes of his trouble, was deſirous to acknowledge his thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe toward him, and asked him whether he remembred ſuch a one?

            </p>
            <p>Many there are, that are aſhamed of ſuch as are of low degree, whom notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding God loueth, for whom the Sauior of the world died, and to whom the word
<pb facs="tcp:7222:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> of ſaluation is preached. When the Church was in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe, it conſiſted not onely of ſuch <note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 17, 12.</note> as <hi>were borne in his houſe,</hi> but of ſuch alſo as were <hi>bought with his money,</hi> of any ſtranger that was not of his ſeed: and when the Lord gaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him the ſeale of his Couenant, he commanded him to circumciſe not only him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his ſonne; his Steward, and the cheefeſt partes of his family, but euery male, euen the leaſt and lowest that lodged vnder his roofe. As then the Wiſe-man ſaith in the Prouerbes, <note n="f" place="margin">Prou. 17. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Hee that mocketh the poore, reproacheth him that made him;</hi> ſo he that deſpiſeth a ſeruant, becauſe he is a ſeruant, diſhonoreth God that made him a ſeruant. Hence it is, that the <note n="g" place="margin">Titus 3, 9, 10</note> Apostle chargeth ſuch to be ſubiect to their Maiſters, <hi>and pleaſe them in all things, not anſwering againe: neither pickers, but that they ſhew al faithfulneſſe, that they may adorne the Doctrine of God our Sauiour in al things.</hi> They are therefore, through pride and diſdaine not a little deceiued, but wander wide out of the way, that thinke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion commeth not downe ſo low as vnto ſeruants, that Gods prouidence vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth not to respect them, &amp; that it booteth not to giue them any inſtruction.

This did <hi>Iob</hi> wiſely <note n="i" place="margin">Iob 31, 13.</note> conſider, Chap. 31. <hi>If I did contemn the iudgement of my ſeruant, &amp; of my Maid, when he did contend with me, what then ſhal I do when God ſtandeth vp?

Theſe perſons iudged it to be no diſgrace or diſparagement to their high calling, nor any ſawcineſſe in their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, to preſume to teach them, and tell them their duty; nay, without guiding themſelues by them, and following their direction, the one had beene expoſed to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſlaughter, the other had returned in the vncleanneſſe of his leproſie; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by this meanes the one was preſerued, the other was cleanſed.

All the prophane Histories, are full of worthy examples of many Seruants, who are commended for their trust and faithfulneſſe; Wittineſſe, and Courage; Might and Magnanimity to all poſterity, and haue not doubted to giue their liues to death, in their Maisters quarrell. It is not therefore much to bee maruelled at, that the Apostle, perceiuing how <note n="t" place="margin">Heb. 4, 12.</note>

            <p>Thus I haue ſet downe to thy view (Christian Reader) the ſcope of this Epiſtle: wherein the Apoſtle (in a narrow compaſſe) doth couch together many Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our Religion, which I haue laboured to lay open in this <hi>Commentary.</hi> And howſoeuer the worke is growne in bigneſſe, &amp; extended in length vnder mine hands more then at the first I purpoſed and intended, yet I hope the manner of handling heerein obſerued, ſhall eaſily recompence thy labour bestowed in reading. I cannot in few words comprehend the matters that are heere and there disperſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Booke. Among many other, theſe points are principally handled. Touching affliction for the truth, and perſecution for righteouſneſſe ſake. Touching Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Equity and Moderation: Touching Gods free grace, &amp; forgiuing offences: Touching houſhold Gouernment and Priuate poſſeſſions: Touching the conuerſion of Sinners, and the Communion of Saintes: Touching Faith, and Good Workes: Touching Friendſhip and Surety-ſhip: Touching Prayer and Hoſpitality: Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpell and Almeſ-deeds: Touching Gods prouidence, and of the force &amp; fruite of the Ministry: as is more at large to be ſeen in the Table of the doctrines. Accept (I pray thee) the paines I haue taken in the diſcuſsing of theſe points, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the eſcapes (if any be) into which I haue fallen, as in trauelling ſo long a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, it is eaſie to fall into a ſlumber: and whereſoeuer thou vnderſtandeſt the hand of God to haue beene with me in publiſhing the truth, giue him the glory, &amp; aſcribe the praiſe vnto his great name, to whoſe grace &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, I commend thee.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Epiſtle is ſhort in Words, low in Argument, and priuate, in regard of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: yet the manner of handling is high and heauenly, and the Doctrine generall and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the whole Church. It was written (as appeareth) to <hi>Philemon,</hi> at what time the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle was growne olde in yeares, was drawing neere his end, and was clapt vp and kept in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at <hi>Rome;</hi> from whence alſo he directed ſundry Epiſtles to diuers Churches and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons. From thence he wrote to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> to the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> to the <hi>Coloſſians;</hi> and the latter Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">2 Tim. 4.</note> which was penned not long before his death and diſſolution. For albeit, he were held in durance and reſtrained of his liberty, that he could not viſit the Churches where the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell was planted, nor lay a new Foundation where as yet it had not beene prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: yet he was not idle or vnfruitfull, but laboured to do good to the Church by writing, when he could not come to beſtow ſome ſpirituall Graces among them by teaching. We ſee heere, that <hi>Paul</hi> writeth out of Priſon, and ſlacketh not to inſtruct, both generall Churches, and particular perſons. From hence we learne, that <note n="b" place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The courſe of the Goſpell cannot be ſtopped.</note> the courſe of the Goſpell cannot be ſtopped, but keepeth on his way and paſſage in the World. The truth of the Goſpell will haue his free libertie, it can be hindred by no Chaines, it can be reſtrained by no Bandes and Boults, it can be ſhut vp by no barres of Iron, and Gates of Braſſe, but breaketh forth as the light of the Sunne out of a darke Cloud. We ſee this euidently in the example of <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Act, 26, 22, 28.</note> albeit he were in bondes and Chaines, yet he pleadeth his cauſe, with ſuch grauitie of ſpeech, with ſuch power of the Spirit, with ſuch piercing of the matter, with ſuch efficacy of words, and with ſuch reſpect of the perſons before whom we ſpake, that he had almoſt gained &amp; perſwaded <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi> to Chriſtianitie. The like we ſee in another place, <note n="d" place="margin">Act. 28, 30, 31.</note> when he was brought Priſoner to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> confined to an Houſe, and deliuered to a Souldier to be kept, he receiued all that came vnto him; <hi>Preaching the Kingdome of God, and teaching thoſe thinges which concerne the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, with all boldneſſe of ſpeech, without let.</hi> This appeareth more euidently in none, then in Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who as at all times he ſought all occaſions and opportunity to doe good to the ſoules and bodies of men, <note n="e" place="margin">Luke 23, 43.</note> ſo when he was vpon the Croſſe, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted the Theefe, and was ready to ſeeke and to ſaue him that was loſt. Theſe conſents of Scripture, come directly to the former point; and ſerue to teach vs, that whatſoeuer the purpoſes and pretences of men be, yet they ſhall neuer bee
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7222:13"/> able to ſtoppe the ſtreame of the word of God, which floweth plentifully to the comforting and refreſhing of the dry and barren hearts of ſinfull men.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 1.</note> Let vs breefely conſider the Reaſons. Firſt, the doctrine deliuered is of God, not of Men; from Heauen, not from the Earth. If man were the Authour of it, it might eaſily bee reſiſted by the power of man; nay, it would in time fall downe of it ſelfe. But ſeeing the whoſe Scripture is inſpired of God, and the doctrine thereof hath him for the Authour, the light of it cannot be quenched. Thus doth <hi>Gamaliell</hi> reaſon in the Councell, <note n="f" place="margin">Acts 5, 39.</note>

                  <hi>The Lord breaketh the Counſell of the Heathen, and bringeth to naught the deuiſes of the people: The Counſell of the Lord ſhall ſtand for euer, and the thoughts of his heart throughout all Ages.</hi> Seeing therefore, that the Doctrine of the Goſpell is of God, and that hee will daſh them in peeces with a Scepter of Iron that ſtop the courſe of it, we may truly conclude, that the courſe thereof cannot be hindered.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</note> The Vſes of this point are many, which I purpoſe breefely to point out, that we may proceede. Firſt, waigh with mee from hence the excellency of the word of God. Who is ignorant what oppoſition hath been and is made againſt it? What reſiſting and contradiction? Yet it keepes on his courſe, and hath his paſſage in the world, and runneth through the whole Earth. The Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, <hi>That the thinges which came vnto him, turned rather to the furthering, then to the hindring of the Gospell,</hi> 
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Phil. 1, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>ſo that his bands in Chriſt were famous through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Iudgement Hall, and in all other places.</hi> So he ſaith afterward in this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle which we haue in hand; <hi>I beſeech thee for my Sonne Oneſimus, whom I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in my bondes.</hi> Was it not enough for the Apoſtle to labour when he was free, and his Feete at liberty, but hee muſt alſo ſpread the Net to catch men in Priſon? The light of Gods truth can neuer be put out, the heat of it cannot bee ſmothered, the power of it cannot bee broken. Though the Teachers and Preachers of the word, may bee ſtocked and ſtoned, hewen aſunder, burned with the Fire, ſlaine with the Sword, clapt vp in Priſon, and fettered in chaines; yet the word it ſelfe <note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 4, 12.</note> is liuelie and mighty in operation, it entreth deepely, it diſcerneth ſharpely, the thoughts and intentes of the heart. True it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Miniſters of the Goſpell may be bound, but the Goſpell it ſelfe cannot be bound. Their hands are bound, and their feete are chained, when the tongue is at liberty to vtter the gracious and glorious promiſes of the Goſpell. Nothing can binde the tongue, but feare and infidelity. If a man binde an Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he hinders his ſowing, for he ſoweth with his handes: but the teachers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound, the word is not bound, for they ſow with the tongue. Let vt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore acknowledge, that the preaching of the Goſpell hath in it a Diuine power, nothing can be matched with it, nothing can be compared vnto it. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill is called in the Scriptures by ſundry Names, to declare his power: the God of the World, the Prince of the Ayre, the ſtrong man that ruleth the Houſe: and he cannot be diſplaced and diſpoſſeſſed but by a ſtronger. But the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is ſtronger then all the power of Sathan, and is able to throw him out, for it gathereth a Church where he hath his Throne, and ruleth in the hearts of the Children of diſobedience; it deliuereth men from the power of the Deuill, and bringeth them into the glorious liberty of the Sonnes of God. If a man were in the ſhaddow of death, and had one foote in Hell, the word of God is able to bring him backe againe, This is it which our Sauiour ſaid to the ſeauentie
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7222:13"/> Diſciples when they returned from preaching the Goſpell, and confirming it by Miracles that followed it; <note n="i" place="margin">Luke 10, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>I ſaw Sathan like Lightning fall downe from Heauen.</hi> Where he teacheth, that albeit Sathan be ſtrong, yet the Goſpell is ſtronger, ſo that he cannot ſtand before it. He hath his ouerthrow by it, and falleth downe before it, as <hi>Dagon</hi> did before the Arke. So the Apoſtle ſheweth, <note n="k" place="margin">Act. 26, 18.</note> that he was called and ſent to <hi>Open the eyes of the blind, that they might be turned from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to light, and from the power of Sathan vnto God.</hi> We ſee it alſo in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt himſelfe vpon the Croſſe, who conuerted the Theefe, gaue him faith and repentance, and aſſured him of eternall bleſſedneſſe in the heauens. The Apoſtles were forbidden to preach the Goſpell: through the mallice and madneſſe of the High-prieſtes, they were apprehended and impriſoned, they were ſcourged and euilly intreated, yet they regarded not the wordes, they deſpiſed the threatnings of all their enemies, and continued to ſound out the Goſpell in all places. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> praied and ſung Pſalmes vnto God in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and I gained the Iayler to the Faith, <note n="l" place="margin">Acts 16, 30.</note> verifying that which the Apoſtle ſpeaks in another place; <note n="m" place="margin">2 Tim. 2, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>I ſuffer trouble as an euill doer, euen vnto bondes, but the word of God is not bound.</hi> Indeede ſometimes it falleth out, that the holy Seruants of God haue their hands tyed, their feet fettered, their bodies impriſoned, &amp; their tongues cut out that they cannot ſpeake to the people; but euen then the word is not bound, for then their conſtant ſuffering and patient bearing of the croſſe, doth as by a liuely voyce, publiſh and proclaime the truth of the Goſpell for which they ſuffer, and ſerueth to win many to the Faith of Chriſt, So then, the patient ſuffering of the faithfull (though they ſpeake not with their tongues) is as a ſolemne preaching, and hath the nature of an effectuall Sermon, to gaine many to the Faith.</p>

The Tyrants of the Earth may bind the profeſſors of the Goſpell, but the Goſpell it ſelfe they cannot binde, and the courſe of it they cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, <hi>Paul</hi> was caſt into priſon, yet he freely preached the Goſpell of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to all that came vnto him. Let all thoſe that ſay it is in vaine to ſerue God and to pray vnto him, know for a ſurety, that it is in vaine for them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt God, and the power of his might. Let them refraine from iniuring his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and from going about to ſtop their mouthes: let them remember what <hi>Gamaliell</hi> ſaid; <note n="n" place="margin">Acts 5, 38.</note> 
                  <hi>Now I ſay vnto you, refraine your ſelues from theſe Men, and let them alone, for if this counſell, or this worke, be of men, it will come to naught.</hi> A no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table leſſon to bee learned of all malicious men, and bloudy perſecuters of the Goſpell, that would if it lay in them, bury all remembrance of Chriſt and his Goſpell, they ſhall finde and feele the ſtrength of him againſt whom they wra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, they ſhall ſee the folly of their owne waies, and the madneſſe of their owne workes, and they ſhall in the end, perceiue it to be as vnpoſſible, and themſelues as vnable to hinder the free paſſage of the Goſpell, as to bind the wind in their Fiſtes, or to ſtop the Raine of Heauen from watering the earth. Hence it is, that the Prophet ſpeaketh to like purpoſe to the Enemies of the Church; <note n="o" place="margin">Eſay 8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Gather together on heapes ô ye people, and ye ſhall be broken in peeces, and hearken all yee of farre Countries, gird your ſelues, and ye ſhall be broken in peeces: gird your ſelues and ye ſhall ſhall bee broken in peeces: Take counſell together, yet it ſhall be brought to naught, pronounce a decree, yet it ſhall not ſtand, for God is with vs.</hi>

We haue a promiſe, that God will ſpread abroade his ſauing health, and magnifie his great Name ouer all the Earth; now it belongeth as a ſpeciall duty to vs, to pray vnto him, to glorifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and to make his Name knowne among the Sonnes of Men.

Let vs be mindfull daily of this duty, deſiring of the Lord this grace, that the Goſpell may be freely preached, and cheerfully receiued, <note n="q" place="margin">Math. 9, 38.</note> that he would ſend forth labourers into his Vineyard, and maintaine them againſt rauening Wolues that ſeeke to deuour them, that he would bleſſe their labours, and remoue all ſtumbling blockes out of their way, that hee would giue them courage and conſtancy in diſcharging their duty, &amp; vtterly remoue al hirelings and falſe teachers out of his Vineyard.

For ſeeing the Goſpell ſhall haue his courſe, let the Miniſters boldly go forward in the diſcharge of their dutie, and teach the people committed to their charge. Let vs not feare the faces of Men. The word which we preach, is the word of God, who is able to maintaine it, and make it mighty in our mouthes, to caſt downe hils and holds that lift vp themſelues againſt it. He is able to danut and daſh in peeces all thoſe that ſet themſelues againſt it. The worke is the Lords, the Worke-men are the Lordes, the bleſſing and ſucceſſe is the Lords, and they that ſtriue againſt it, fight againſt the Lorde. Let vs comfort our ſelues in theſe thinges againſt all the diſgraces and reproaches of the World. And concerning the Profeſſors of this Goſpell, let this Miniſter comfort alſo vnto them, that they builde not vpon the Sand, or vppon a weake Foundation, but their building ſtandeth vpon a Rocke which ſhall neuer be remooued. The Apoſtles comfort themſelues, and encourage one another <note n="r" place="margin">Acts 4, 29.</note> in the worke of the Miniſtery, becauſe they were aſſured that the word which they deliuered, was no vaine word, nor deceiueable Fable, but the Goſpell of Chriſt who choſe them to the calling, and ſent them to the worke, and ſtrengthned them to ſtand, and gaue them wiſedome to conuince and confound all their Aduerſaries.

All ſuch as repent and beleeue the Goſpell, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Maiſters, or Seruants, high or low, rich or poore, are accepted of him who is Lord of all, and with whom is no reſpect of perſons.

Many are wronged and oppreſſed of Men, of whom the high God of Heauen taketh care and charge. We are ready to reſpect the outward face and perſon of Men, but he regardeth the heart. God the Father loueth them, woe therefore to them that hate them. Chriſt Ieſus came to ſaue and redeeme them; woe therefore to all them that ſeeke to hurt and deſtroy them. It pleaſeth God oftentimes to call the Seruant, and to let the Maiſter alone, ſuffering him to perriſh in his ſinnes.

Secondly, the ſubſtance and matter of the Epiſtle, in the reſt. The Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face or entrance, containeth the inſcription or Title, in theſe two verſes, &amp; ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry prayers in the foure verſes following. The inſcription, remembreth both the parties writing; to wit, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy:</hi> and likewiſe, the perſons to whom the Epiſtle is written; <hi>Philemon, Apphia, Archippus,</hi> and the Church that was in <hi>Philemons</hi> houſe. Theſe perſons, as well writing, as written vnto, are not barely and nakedly ſet downe, but are deſcribed by their ſeuerall notes and titles giuen vnto them, wherein are contained ſeuerall Arguments of perſwaſion, to mooue <hi>Philemon</hi> to that whereunto he exhorteth and intreateth him. And firſt for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, a Captiue and Priſoner, hee mooueth him to reſpect his ſuit, in regard it was the ſuit of one vnder perſecution, bound in chaines, and kept in thraldome, whom he ought to pitty, eſpecially ſeeing he was a Priſoner of Ieſus Chriſt; that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7222:16"/> is, not for any bad cauſe, but for the profeſſing and Preaching of the glorious Goſpell of Chriſt. Secondly, he ioyneth in this ſuit with him, <hi>Timothy</hi> a Brother, nay more then a Brother, a famous Euangeliſt, whoſe commendation was tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout all the Churches, who with him intreated for his Seruant. Moreouer, concerning thoſe to whom this Epiſtle is written; firſt <hi>Philemon</hi> himſelfe is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, with whom he preſumeth to preuaile, both becauſe there is mutuall loue between them, louing one another in the truth and Chriſtian Faith, and becauſe he is a fellow-helper, ſeeking to promote and further, by all good meanes, the courſe of the Goſpell, in both which reſpects, there ſhould be a neere familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſpeciall intereſt one with another.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to him he ioyneth <hi>Apphia,</hi> which ſeemeth to be his Wife, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe hath the ſecond place after <hi>Philemon,</hi> and becauſe ſhe is ſet before <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chippus,</hi> who was the Paſtor and Miniſter of that Church, as we ſhall ſee after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. He calleth her a beloued Siſter, moſt deare vnto him for the common faith, mouing her alſo to plead this cauſe, and to further this requeſt with her husband, whom he would not nor could not deny, in ſo reaſonable a ſuit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he nameth <hi>Archippus,</hi> and calleth him a Fellow-Souldier, becauſe they of the Miniſtery (if they be faithfull) are in continuall warfare, not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the continuall engines and aſſaults of Sathan, who withſtandeth their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, but againſt falſe teachers, and againſt many vnreaſonable men, as alſo againſt the ſinnes and corruptions that raigne or ariſe in their ſeuerall charges. We ſee how men deſtitute of faith, make continual warre againſt them, one way or other.</p>
               <p>This man thus deſcribed by his Office, was Paſtor and Preacher of the word in the Church of <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> 
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Coloſ. 4, 17.</note> as appeareth by the wordes of the Apoſtle, writing to the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> Chap. 4. <hi>Say to Archippus, take heed to the miniſtery that thou haſt receiued in the Lord, that thou fulfill it.</hi> He nameth him with the reſt, becauſe the Paſtors and Miniſters of the Church, ought to preuaile much with all the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors and people that are vnder their charge, beeing to them in place of Fathers, that may or ſhould commaund in the Lord.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, he remembreth the Family of <hi>Philemon,</hi> which he doth entitle with an honorable Name, calling it a Church: which ſerueth to the ſinguler commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Seruant of God, as one that did ſo guide, inſtruct, and gouerne his priuate Houſhhold (as all faithfull Gouernours of Families ought to do) as that it might truely be reputed a company and Congregation of Men, Women, and Children, that are dedicated vnto God, to his worſhip and obedience, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſaying of Chriſt; <note n="u" place="margin">Math. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Where two or three be gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</hi> Euery Chriſtian Family, is a particular and little Church, where God is ſincerely honoured and worſhipped, which is another ſpeciall reaſon to win <hi>Philemon</hi> to his purpoſe, thinking ſo reuerently and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of him and his priuate charge.</p>

If wee ſhould ſtand vppon euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular point that might be raiſed out of the Text, it would be both endleſſe and fruiteleſſe. Againe, the Scripture is as a liuely Fountaine, that can neuer be dryed vp: it is as a rich Treaſury, that neuer can be emptyed. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, before that we come to handle the principall and eſpeciall Doctrines, it ſhall not bee amiſſe to point out diuers inſtructions that the Apoſtle intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.</p>
               <p>And firſt, marke, that among all that are heere named, none is mentioned without his Title of honour, to teach, that euery one ought to haue ſome-what to commend him, and whoſoeuer lead an vpright and holy life, their name ought to be renowned and honoured in the Church of Chriſt, which ſhould alſo cauſe them to be well reported of vnto poſterity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, obſerue that <hi>Paule</hi> ioyneth with him <hi>Timothy:</hi> he excelled him in the greatneſſe of guifts, and in the function of Apoſtle-ſhip, yet hee calleth him
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7222:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> his Brother, thereby giuing vs an example of Chriſtian modeſty, whereby it commeth to paſſe, that the godly, as they are placed in an higher degree, do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue themſelues ſo much more lowly. So the Apoſtle willeth vs, <note n="x" place="margin">Rom. 12, 16 Phil. 2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Not to be high minded, but to make our ſelues equall to them of the lower ſort, and to thinke better of others then of our ſelues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, albeit he were the principall that wrote, and <hi>Philemon</hi> the chiefe to whom this Epiſtle is written, yet to himſelfe he ioyneth <hi>Timothy,</hi> and to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon</hi> he annexeth as Helpers in his ſuit, <hi>Apphia</hi> his Wife, <hi>Archippus</hi> the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and the reſt of the Church in his houſe, all which he muſtereth together as meane, to make an attonement with his Maiſter, which example teacheth all Chriſtians, eſpecially the Miniſters of the word to ſeeke peace, and labour to make peace among Bretheren, that one may be reconciled vnto another, and al men liue in charity and vnity together. Heereunto commeth the counſell and commaundement of Chriſt our Sauiour; <note n="y" place="margin">Math. 5, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed are the Peace-makers, for they ſhall be called the Children of God.</hi> Hereby we ſhall giue comfort to mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and remooue the ſtumbling blockes and offences that daily ariſe among Neighbours. On the other ſide, we may truly ſay; <hi>Curſſed are all debate makers, for they ſhall be called the Children of the Deuill.</hi> For ſuch as make debate and raiſe contention, and kindle ſtrife between Brother and Brother is as it were caſting Oyle into the fire, are not of God, who is the Authour of loue, but are guided by the ſpirit of the Deuill, whoſe workes they follow and practiſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in ioyning all theſe as Mediators for <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> we ſee the ſingular wiſedome of the Apoſtle, he leaueth nothing vnattempted to effect his purpoſe. He doth not deale ſlightly and rawly, but vſeth conuenient meanes and fit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to worke this reconcilement. For he employeth and ioyneth the helpe of <hi>Apphia</hi> and <hi>Archippus</hi> to appeaſe the Maiſter, and to draw him to receiue his Seruant into his former fauour.

I ſay, impriſonment, afflictions, and troubles, fall vpon the beſt Seruants of God, without any reproch or ſhame vnto them.

It is in vaine for vs to thinke, to be exempted out of the common condition of theſe men.

Let vs not thinke them the greateſt Sinners for their greateſt ſufferings, nor reproch them as wicked men, for ſuſtaining the reproches of wicked men. All they that iudge thus, are deceiued in their iudgement.

Or thinke you that thoſe eighteene vpon whom the Tower in Siloam fell and ſlew them, were ſinners aboue all men that dwell in Ieruſalem, I tell you nay: but except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> Laſtly, let vs be ſo farre from triumphing ouer them, and trampling vpon them that endure affliction, that rather in their ſufferings wee ſhould ſuffer with them; in their weeping, we ſhould weep with them; in their mournings, we ſhould mourne with them; in their miſeries, we ſhould pray for them; that ſo we may ſhew our ſelues members of one and the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with them, according to the precept of the Apoſtle; <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 12, 16.

                  <hi>That none of vs ſuffer as a Murtherer, or as a Theefe, or an euill Doer, or as a Buſie-body in other Mens matters: But if a Man ſuffer as a Christian, let him not bee aſhamed, but let him glorifie GOD in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe.</hi> Many men ſuffer ſhame and reproach, but it is for their offences:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7222:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> in ſuch ſufferings, we want peace of conſcience, and comfort vnder the croſſe. If we ſuffer as drunkards, as robbers, as riotous perſons, we ſuffer for our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and deſerts, we cannot reioyce and be glad when we ſuffer in this manner. But it is better (if the will of God bee ſo) that we ſuffer for well doing, then for euill doing, for Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffered for ſinnes, the iuſt for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, that he might bring vs to God. Wherefore, if God at any time call vs out for the Goſpels ſake to ſuffer aduerſity, let vs heerein reioyce with an exceeding great ioy, and neuer be aſhamed of the Goſpell, which is the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God to ſaluation vnto all that beleeue. <hi>Many</hi>

The Chaines that are borne and worne, for keeping faith and a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, are greater ornaments, then all the Chaines of Gold about the Neckes of the Men of this World. The Fetters wherewith the faithfull are laden, are of greater price and eſtimation, then all the Bracelets and Abilements, then all the Siluer and Gold, that the Sonnes and Daughters of Men delight to carrie about them. Hence it is, that the bleſſed Martyrs that gaue their liues for the truth, when they came to ſuffer death, kiſſed the ſtake to which they were tied, the Chaine with which they were compaſſed, and the Wood by which they were burned and conſumed. Wee ſee it is the manner of the men of this World, to ſet out themſelues with pomp and brauery, to win credit, and to get themſelues honour and eſtimation, whereof we haue an example in <hi>Herod,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the <hi>Actes:</hi>

Seruants are knowne whom they ſerue, and to what Maiſter they belong, by the Badge on their ſleeue. The perſecutions and afflictions of the faithfull, are the Badges and Cognizances of Chriſt, whereby they are knowne to be his. This is it <note n="e" place="margin">Gal. 6, 17.</note> which the Apoſtle putteth vs in mind of. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. <hi>From henceforth let no man put me to buſineſſe, for I beare in my body the markes of the Lord Ieſus.</hi> Where wee ſee, how the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calleth his ſufferings for the Goſpell, the markes of Chriſt. What theſe markes are, he ſheweth in other places, when he reporteth the ſtripes, whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, ſcarres, and blemiſhes which hee bare about in his body; <hi>I thinke that God hath ſet forth vs the laſt Apoſtles,</hi>

We ſee how Souldiers that fight in a good cauſe, in their Princes quarrell, and for the defence of their Countrey, if they looſe an Eye, or an Arme, or a Legge, are ready to ſhew the place, they account it no blemiſh, they are not aſhamed of it. If theſe can vaunt of the markes and maimes which they haue ſuſtained: how much more honour and glory ſhould we account it, to beare the markes of Chriſt, and to ſuffer reproach with the people of God? Howſoeuer therefore the World iudgeth of the ſcourgings, whippings, and impriſonments of the faithfull, they are truely and rightly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable with God and good men.

It is the cauſe that maketh the croſſes of Chriſtians to be the Croſſe of Chriſt. The Apoſtle teſtifieth he was a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for Chriſt and the Goſpell, not for his owne ſinnes and offences. It is not our ſuffering barely and nakedly conſidered, can honour vs with the reward of glory, and the Crowne of Martyrdome, <note n="g" place="margin" type="runSum">The cauſe maketh a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, not the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</note> but the cauſe in which we dye, and the quarrell in which we ſuffer. True it is, afflictions are common to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vngodly, they ſuffer alike, they are impriſoned alike, arraigned, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and executed oftentimes alike, but albeit the afflictions bee one and the ſame, yet the cauſe is not one and the ſame for which they are afflicted. The vngodly ate puniſhed for their ſinnes; the godly are afflicted for a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. <hi>Abell</hi> is murthered of his Brother; <hi>Caine</hi> is curſſed and condemned to be a fugitiue vpon the earth: both of them are afflicted, but the cauſe is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe; <hi>Abell</hi> is killed for his godlineſſe; <hi>Caine</hi> is puniſhed for his wickedneſſe. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> is ſold to Strangers and caſt into priſon, ſo likewiſe are <hi>Pharaohs</hi> two Eunuches, his Butler and his Baker: they lye all in one priſon, but they had not one cauſe: for he is committed through the ſlaunders and falſe accuſations of his Miſtreſſe, they for their demerites and offences againſt their Maiſter. Chriſt had his feete and his handes nayled on the Croſſe, ſo had the two Theeues, they ſuffered al one puniſhment, but how contrary were the cauſes of him and them, ſeeing he ſuffered without cauſe, but they iuſtly and worthily had the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death executed vpon them? Let vs not therefore onely faſten our eies, and looke vpon the bare punniſhment, but conſider what the cauſe is, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cauſe, eſteeme both of the perſon and of the puniſhment. Some are priſoners <note n="h" place="margin">Math. 5, 25.</note> of men, <note n="i" place="margin">2 Tim. 2, 26.</note> others are Priſoners of the Deuill, of whom they are holden captiue, and both of them for their wickedneſſe: but if we will be Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirs of Chriſt, we muſt be the priſoners of Chriſt. This ſerueth to reprooue the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who glory in their Martyrs (as ſometimes the <hi>Donatists</hi> did) and fill vp their Kalender with ſuch as they haue canonized for Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, which were no better then Traytors when they liued vpon the earth. The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which vaunteth her ſelfe to be the onely true Church of God, and condemneth other, honoureth diuers Saintes which neuer were in the World; ſome that were <hi>Pagans;</hi> others, that were <hi>Iewes</hi> in Religion, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Chriſt; and others, that were Heretiques and Traytors, that neyther had Faith on Earth, nor haue ſaluation in Heauen, beeing Rebels to their Princes, and enemies to their Countrey, and diſturbers of the State. And therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it condemneth thoſe, who albeit they liue vnder the Goſpell, and ſhroud themſelues vnder the branches of it, as vnder a comfortable ſhaddow, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they haue refreſhed and enriched themſelues, yet they magnifie the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſet vp the Faith profeſſed therein, they ballance it equall with the true Church of God among our ſelues, and thereby ſeeke to ſhake in ſunder the Faith of many. Theſe men cry out, not onely that there are and haue been learned men on both ſides, but Saintes and holy men on both ſides, and true Martyrs on both ſides; and therefore would haue the people carryed about with vncertainety of Doctrine, as with a waue of the Sea. But we deny that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny haue ſuffered among vs for the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith, or haue beene led to execution for their Religion. The truth is, they haue but too much fauour ſhewed them, and too great liberty giuen them. Indeede, ſuch as haue beene found factious and forward to aduance forraigne power, to adhere to forraigne enemies, to ſtirre the people to rebell and take armes againſt the Prince, to compaſſe the death and deſtruction of the Prince, ſuch as haue beene Authors of treacheries and conſpiracies, and beene conuinced to be trumpets of ſedition by the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of witneſſes, by the forme of their tryall, and by their owne confeſſions, haue beene iuſtly executed among vs, as by all men muſt needes be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.

No forraine Prince will repute them for his people and Subiects, that ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to take his part againſt any forraine Vſurper or Inuador whatſoeuer. So the Lawes of our Land haue ſeized vpon ſome, who haue buſied themſelues in matters of State, bringing ouer Buls, declaring that the Prince was to bee depoſed, and the Subiects diſcharged of their alleagiance. As for pointes of Faith, they were neuer mentioned in the proceedings againſt them, they were not called into queſtion for their opinion concerning the Maſſe, for tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, for worſhipping of Images, or for any other point of the Romiſh Religion, or rather ſuperſtition.

True Martyrs ſuffered for the truth wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and therefore deſerued commendation, according to the rule of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle: <note n="l" place="margin">1 Pet. 2, 19.</note>

It is a great conſolation for them that are afflicted for Chriſts ſake, to aſſwage their ſorrow, and a great meanes to worke in them patience, to conſider that Chriſt putteth all their teares in his Bottle, and accounteth their afflictions to be his afflictions. If we ſuffer with Chriſt, we ſhall raigne with him: if we dye with Chriſt, we ſhall liue with him: if we <note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 8, 29. 2 Tim. 2, 11, 12 1 Pet. 4, 12.</note> be made like vnto him in ignominy, wee ſhall be made like vnto him in glory.

On the other ſide, this ſerueth to terrifie the hearts of all perſecuters of the godly, and Enemies of all righteouſneſſe, they can neuer eſcape the hand of God and of Chriſt, whom they do perſecute in his members. They haue not to doe onely with men like vnto themſelues, but with him that is the eternall God, againſt whom they can neuer preuaile. This is it that deceiueth the proud perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the poore people of God, they dreame they haue to doe no further then with weake men, who are not able to reſiſt them, and that they haue no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account to make.

In all doing of duties there <note n="z" place="margin">Pſal. 19, 11.</note> is profit &amp; reward, but where greater ſtrength is ioyned and force vnited, there is greater fruit of the labour ſeene.

When a man doth take a iourney into a farre place, it falleth out oftentimes that hee commeth into ſome great danger, out of which he is neuer able to ridde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and therefore wo to him that is alone. This is more dangerous in the matters of the ſoule, if a man fall into ſinne, and haue no man to pull him out of the pit into which he is fallen.

But in ſpirituall falles which are more common and more dangerous, the caſe is far otherwiſe. For he that falleth into ſinne, is ſcarce euer lifted vp and ſet on his feete, vnleſſe by the exhortations, admonitions, and reproofes of others he be reſtored and recouered.

Firſt, this teacheth vs, that in all occaſions and aduentures of our life, both in proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and aduerſity, we ſhould vſe and ſeeke the helpe one of another. We ſay commonly, that two eyes ſee more then one, and three more then two. Two hands are better to worke withall, then one.

The Philoſophers could ſay, that ſuch as leaue the ſociety of men, and betake themſelues to a ſolitary life, are eyther a God, or a Beaſt. Experience doth teach vs, that all of vs doe ſtand in need of the help of another; the high, of ſuch as are low; the rich, of ſuch as are poore; ſo as we are bound together by common fellowſhip, as by a ſtrong band, and one of vs cannot be without another. Let no man therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe his Brother, neyther let the head ſay to the foote, I haue no need of thee. The Lyon which is accounted as the King of all the Beaſts of the Forreſt, may want the helpe of the ſeely Mouſe. Let vs ſet no man at naught, be he neuer ſo ſeely and ſimple. All humaine things are vncertaine and vnſtable, and are turned as with a ſwift wheele. Let vs therefore maintaine peace and concord one with another, that when we want, the comfort and counſel, the aide and aſſiſtance one of another, we may not be to ſeeke of them, but haue them at

An army of men ſo long as they incamp together, and march together, <note n="e" place="margin">2 Sam. 10, 9, 10, 11.</note> are not eaſily ſubdued, but one ſerueth to ſtrengthen another: but if they goe ſtragling and forraging out of order, if they fall to the prey and pillage, euery one prouiding for himſelfe, it falleth out oftentimes, that the Conquerors haue beene conquered and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. And as there is great vſe and benefit in the company and ſociety one of another, in regard of earthly and temporall things, ſo is there greater profit of it in regard of ſpirituall things. We haue need to be inſtructed and comforted, to be admoniſhed and aduiſed one of another. We want daily, the daily praiers one of another, to commend our ſelues and our Brethren to God.

Firſt, ſeeing the Woman is made by the Law of her Creation to be an helper; we learne, that a good and Chriſtian Wife that is wiſe and godly, encouraging her Husband, and ſtirring him vp to godlineſſe, is a great bleſſing of God. If ſhee finde her Husband backward and vntoward, cold and careleſſe in good thinges, ſhee will labour wiſely to bring him on, and to conceiue a liking of them, that before diſtaſted with him. If ſhee perceiue him forward, ſhee will endeuour to make him yet more forward. If ſhe finde a ſparke, ſhe will ſtriue to kindle the Coales, and make it flame out to the comfort of many other. If ſhe ſee him wauer and waxe faint, ſhe will neuer ceaſe vntill ſhe haue ſtrengthned and ſuſtained him. If ſhe find a good beginning, ſhe will further it by a timely proceeding, and a conſcionable perſeuering vnto the end. It is a worthy ſaying ſet downe by <hi>Salomon:</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Pro. 18, 22. and 19.</note>

She bringeth a bleſſing to his perſon, to his Children, to his Family, to the meanes of his maintenance, and to his whole eſtate. She will ſeeke to better his eſtate (howſoeuer ſhe find it) both with God and the world, in heauenly thinges, and in earthly. This reproueth ſuch as deſtroy or hinder his eſtate, impoueriſh him, decay him, or vndoe him, whether by dainty and delicate fare, or by gay and gorgeous apparrell, by coſtly and ſumptuous fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, by feaſting or idleneſſe, by careleſneſſe and negligence, or by any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity whatſoeuer. <hi>A wiſe Woman</hi> (ſaith the <note n="d" place="margin">Prou. 14, 1.</note> Wiſe man) <hi>buildeth vp her houſe, but the fooliſh deſtroyeth it with her owne hand.</hi> Secondly, it reprooueth

                  <hi>A fooliſh Sonne is the calamity of his Father, and the contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Wife, are like a continuall dropping:</hi> Where he compareth the braulings and chidings of a Woman, to the couer of an houſe, which is ſo broken, that when it raineth, the Water droppeth in vpon the Planckes and Wals, and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Timber of the houſe, ſo that in ſhort time, it is very ruinous and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to fall.

Ciuill wars were alwaies held among the Heathen moſt dangerous: but the iars that are at home, and made within the Walles of the houſe, are as noyſome and grieuous, and doe threaten the ruine thereof.

It is a great point of wiſedome to take the occaſion: and there is a fit time for euery purpoſe vnder the Heauens. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle chargeth <note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 7, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>euery one to abide in his calling,</hi> when he ſpeaketh of the Womans winning of her Husband.

It is a great profite and aduantage to do a thing in ſeaſon. On the other ſide, it is the note of vnwiſe and wicked Women, to drawe their Husbands to all wickedneſſe and outragiouſneſſe, to further them in impiety and vngodlineſſe, and conſequently to haſten their owne and their Husbands ruine and deſtruction. If there be any ſparke of godlineſſe, they are as water to quench it in their Husbands. An example hereof we haue in <hi>Iezabell,</hi> when <hi>Ahab</hi> longed after the Vine-yard of <hi>Naboth,</hi> and could not obtaine it, ſo that he came to his houſe heauy and in diſpleaſure: did ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Kinges heart to bee content?

                  <hi>Let a man ſo thinke of vs, as of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and dispoſers of the ſecrets of God: and as for the the reſt, it is required of the Diſpoſers, that euery Man be found faithfull.</hi> So he teacheth in another place: <note n="b" place="margin">1 Tim. 3, 1.</note> 
                  <hi>This is a true ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, If any Man deſire the office of a Biſhop, he deſireth a worthy worke.</hi> Where he ſheweth indeede, that the calling is a worthy calling, but it requireth alſo worthy labouring. This will farther appeare vnto vs, if we conſider the Titles that are giuen vnto them. They are called Builders, that are continually buſie in building, hewing tough Timber, and ſquaring rough ſtones. No Timber, no Stones of themſelues ſo vnfit for building, as we are by Nature to be cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together, and to grow vnto an holy Temple in the Lord. They are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Souldiers, they are alwaies fighting or looking for their enemies, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Sword of the Spirit, <note n="c" place="margin">Ephe. 6, 17.</note> which is the word of God. Is any cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vnder Heauen more neceſſary, then the profeſsion of a Souldier in time of danger? And when an aſſault is made, or the battels ioyne, is any profeſsion more painefull? Sometimes they are called Husband-men. Is not the life of the Husband-man a painefull life, and is not the ending of one worke the beginning of another? Doth not euery ſeaſon of the yeare bring his ſeuerall trauell? So that no calling is accompanied with more labour and leſſe eaſe. Sometimes they are called Watch-men, who ſtand continually on their watch Tower, to diſcry the comming and approaching of the Enemy. Sometimes they are called Shepheards, abiding in the fielde, and keeping watch by night ouer their flocke; they are in the day conſumed with heate, and with Froſt in the night, and their ſleepe departeth from their eyes. Seeing therefore the Miniſters aie builders of the Lordes houſe, Souldiers in the Lordes Campe, Husbandmen in the Lords fielde, Watch-men in the Lordes Citty, and Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardes ouer the Lordes flocke, which hee hath redeemed with his precious blood; we muſt all confeſſe, that the Miniſtry of the word is a worke of great labour, if it be diſcharged aright. For this, if wee know not by practiſe, wee may ſee by experience, that to ſtudy with conſtantneſſe, to meditate with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to inſtruct with diligence, to exhort with carefulneſſe, to reproue with zeale, to comfort with cheerefulneſſe, to conuince with boldneſſe, to watch ouer the people with a godly <note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 13, 17.</note> ouer-ſight, as they that muſt giue accountes for their Soules, to conceiue godly anger and great ſorrow for ſinne, to pray in publike and priuate, to goe in and out before the people of God in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Faith, and in example of life, to prepare themſelues to handle the word, and to deliuer it with power and euidence of the ſpirit, with earneſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, being thus prepared; I ſay to performe all theſe duties, dooth more conſume the inward parts, waſt the body, impaire nature, decay ſtrength, ſpend the vitall Spirits, and cauſe them to be ſubiect to ſundry infirmities, ſickneſſes, and diſeaſes, then any the ſtrongeſt labour that is vſed among men. For this we may obſerue, that the labours of the body (though they bee great) main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſtrength, preſerue the ſtomacke, encreaſe the appetite, and adde vigour to euery part: but it is farre otherwiſe in the labours of the mind, they weaken the naturall powers, they waſt the vitall Spirits, and they decay the health of the body.

Touching the Miniſters, it ſerueth as a good admonition to ſuch as purpoſe and intend to enter into this great calling of the Miniſterie, that they doe it wiſely and warily, that they runne not before they bee ſent, that they enter at the Doore, and climbe not in at the Windowe, that they conſidet what prouiſion, and ſtore of new and old they haue, to goe through the worke.

The order and diſcipline of the Warres is ſuch, that ſo ſoone as the Souldier hath enrolled and giuen his name to his Captaine, he leaueth his houſe and other affaires, which might with-draw his minde, and mindeth nothing but the battell. So ought we to bee wholie looſed, and throughlie freed from the impediments and incumbrances of this Worlde, that Chriſt may haue our ſeruice in this warfare.

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 1.</note> The Reaſons inforcing this Doctrine, are many in number, ſtrong in value, and manifeſt in the view of all that will rightly conſider of them. For firſt, all Chriſtians are generally charged <note n="k" place="margin">Leuit. 19. Hebr. 3 13. 1 Theſ. 5, 11.</note> to exhort and admoniſh one another, as we ſee. 1. Theſſ. 5. 11. Heb. 3. 13. 14. Leuit. 19. 17. So then, vnleſſe the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of Families will exempt themſelues out of the number of Chriſtians, they cannot ſhake off this yoake, but they are bound to edifie and exhort daily their Families, leaſt their harts be hardned through the deceitfulneſſe of ſin. If then we be bound generally to admoniſh one another, euen thoſe to whom we are leſſe bound, much more are we to do it to ſuch, as we are tyed vnto by a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble band, and a neerer coniunction.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 2.</note> Secondly, euery Mans houſe is his priuate charge, which he muſt ouer-ſee, it is as his Flocke which he muſt attend, it is as his Cittie, ouer which he muſt watch: and thereby fit them for the hearing of the publique Miniſtery of the word; and therefore muſt anſwere for their negligence. This wee ſee in the example of <hi>Eli.</hi> 1. Sam. 2. 29. He is charged with the ſinnes <note n="l" place="margin">1 Sam. 2, 29</note> of his Children which they had committed, and to haue honoured them aboue the Lord. This is a greeuous fault, and an horrible offence, to ſet yp our Sonnes in ſtead of God, and to make more account of them then we do of the moſt high. Hence it is that <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith; <note n="m" place="margin">Pro. 27, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Be diligent to know the State of thy Flock, and take heed to the Heards.</hi> Such as are Shepheards, ouer the Sheepe of the Paſture which are vnreaſonable, ought to care &amp; prouide for them: much more ought ſuch to be diligent and watchfull, as haue the people of God committed vnto them, and haue a charge to looke to his ſheep which are indued with reaſon, whoſe Soules are immortall, who beare the Image of God vpon them, and for whom Chriſt Ieſus ſhed his moſt pure and precious blood. Euery man hath ſome charge or other, greater or leſſer, in the Church, in the Common-wealth, or in the family: and euery one muſt be diligent to know the eſtate of this charge,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7222:32"/> labouring earneſtlie to diſcharge it. And if we will make conſcience of our dutie, wee ſhall finde the leaſt flocke enough for our feeding, the leaſt fielde ſufficient for our tilling, the leaſt houſe great enough for our teaching and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 3.</note> Thirdly, we may be drawne to the diſcharging of this duty, if we conſider the profite and benefites that ariſe from hence. Firſt, it will bee a meanes to make them more carefully to learne to know the will of God, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it ſhall be required of them, and an account taken how they heare. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it will cauſe them to retaine in mind and memory the better, the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which they haue learned, when they haue whetted them vpon their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. Thirdly, God will encreaſe his guiftes and graces that are in them alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, he will bleſſe them with a new ſupplie, for to him that hath ſhall be giuen, and he ſhall haue aboundance. Fourthly, it will breede and begin great obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and dutifulneſſe in all the degrees of their Families; firſt to God, then to themſelues; and afterward to others, to the preuenting of a thouſand houſhold greefes and troubles, that ariſe for want thereof. This obedience is a thing which all Fathers and Maiſters greatly deſire. Euery one deſireth to haue dutifull Children and faithfull Seruants: this is the way and courſe to be taken, that we may attaine vnto it. So when ſuch as haue beene inſtructed and nurtered by vs, ſhall goe abroade into other families of their owne, and grow to haue houſes themſelues, as they haue beene inſtructed, ſo will they inſtruct their Seruants, and deale toward them as they haue beene dealt withall themſelues. Laſtly, the publike miniſtery is made more fruitfull vnto them, in that the ſeede ſowne in their harts is watered, and thereby made to ſpring vp. And this is found true by daily experience in our aſſemblies, that let the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter teach neuer ſo diligently in his charge, vnleſſe there bee a ſeconding and furthering of his labours, in ſeuerall families at home, all the doctrine deliuered and heard, is troden vnder foot, choked, and forgotten.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 4.</note> Fourthly, innumerable are the euils, and manifolde are the miſchiefes that come of the neglecting of this duty. Firſt, it is the Mother of all the ignorance and groſſe blindneſſe, that ouerfloweth and ouerthroweth the Church. For from what cauſe commeth ignorance, but from the want of teaching, as dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe proceedeth from the want of light? Secondly, it cauſeth the Leſſons and inſtructions taught on the day of the publique aſſembly, to bee forgotten of Maiſter and Man, of Mother and Daughter, of Father and Childe, before the next day. Often teaching and much repeating, make a diligent Maiſter, and a profitable Scholler. Thirdly, from hence come all domeſticall braules, contentions, ſtubbornneſſe, and diſobedience, that the Houſe is diuided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it ſelfe, which would be remedied and preuented by this meanes. Laſtly, the neglect of this duty, bringeth Gods iudgements vpon the whole Familie. So then, whether we conſider the common duty of exhorting that lieth vpon all, or that the priuate houſe is a priuate Church, or that the benefits are many where this duty is practiſed, &amp; the euils many that grow where it is neglected: in all theſe reſpectes we ſee, that it is a ſpeciall duty required of all gouernors, to labour, to plant, and to ſow the Seedes of true Religion in the heart, as it were in the ground of thoſe that are committed vnto them.</p>

They are aſhamed of it, becauſe it is good, becauſe it is commaunded: but they are not aſhamed of committing open ſinnes in open

Secondly, conſider, that young men are commanded <note n="h" place="margin">Eccle. 12, 1.</note> to <hi>remember their Creator in the daies of their youth, and ſhall giue an account of all thinges vnto God.</hi> As for their ſtubbornneſſe, the word of God is the beſt remedy to bend them, and make them pliable vnto all goodneſſe: ſo that the Prophet ſaith; <note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 119, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Wherewith ſhall a young Man redreſſe his way?

If admonitions will not winne them, they are to bee auoyded: thy houſe is better without them, then with them. Neither are we to feare their flying away, and departing to another place: for if this courſe of inſtruction were taken in hand euery where, the Obiection were anſwered, and their mouths ſtopped. For whether would they goe to eſcape this training vp in the principles of Religion? It is certaine they could turne themſelues no whither, but it would meete with them in all places. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiect. 6.</note> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers obiect, our Fathers did well enough without obſeruing any ſuch order; I trow you will not condemne them. Why ſhould wee make ourſelues wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer then they? They troubled not themſelues or their Children with learning of Catechiſmes: and wee ſee men doe well enough proſper in the World, yet buſie not their heads about this. I anſwere, if they meane thoſe forefathers and Anceſtors, whoſe ſteps we ſhould follow, as <hi>Adam, Abraham, Iſaac, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Ioſua, Dauid,</hi> and diuers others, which were indeede our Fathers, then we may bee aſſured out of the word of truth, that theſe buſied and beſtirred themſelues this way: they taught their Children, they inſtructed their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, they reformed diſorders, they remooued the diſordered. If they meane our forefathers that liued in latter times, when darkeneſſe couered the earth, no maruell if they were not vrged, thereunto themſelues, or that they vrged not others, for then they liued at the dyet of the Prelats, and nothing pleaſed the Prelats better then the ignorance of the people, <note n="k" place="margin">Math. 15, 14</note> they were the blinde Leaders of the blinde, they could neither enter into the Kingdome of heauen themſelues, nor ſuffer thoſe that would enter. Notwithſtanding, we will not meddle with condemning our forefathers, neither will we iuſtifie them, both theſe belong vnto God; and therefore are not to be vſurped by any man. We muſt iudge the beſt of them, according to the rule of Charity, <note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 13, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth all thinges, and beleeueth all thinges.</hi> We know God reſerued to himſelfe <note n="m" place="margin">1 King. 19, 18.</note> 7000. in Iſraell, in the daies of <hi>Ahab,</hi> that neuer bowed the knee to <hi>Baall:</hi> and he hath a few <note n="n" place="margin">Reuel. 3, 4.</note> names yet in <hi>Sardis,</hi> which haue not defiled their garments, which ſhall walke with him in white, for they are worthy.

And touching the thriuing and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering of them that neglect this duty: this is an Obiection fitter for Atheiſts, then Chriſtians to vſe.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7222:33"/> The world ſpeaketh euill of thoſe that will not follow them into all exceſſe of ryot.

For I am ſure, this courſe of learning is not the cauſe of the looſeneſſe of their liuing. If grace had beene in their hearts, it would bee a meanes to make them beleeue and liue better. He that knoweth his Maiſters will, is more likely to performe it, then he that knoweth it not, nor careth for the knowing of it. He that hath his eye-ſight, is more likely to walke without ſtumbling and falling, then he that is blinde: ſo he that is inſtructed in the waies of godlineſſe, hath better meanes to walke in the feare of God, then hee that is ignorant and knoweth nothing. True it is, ſome that know their Maiſters will doe it not: ſome that haue their eyes open, fall downe now and then: yet none can be ſo voide of reaſon to conclude from hence, that it is not neceſſary to know his will, or to open our eyes.

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</note> Now let vs come to the Vſes of this Doctrine. Firſt, ſeeing it belongeth to the Maiſters and Gouernours of Families, to inſtruct them in godlineſſe, we gather, that it is not enough for them to prouide for the bodies of ſuch as are vnder them, and belong vnto them in this life, but they muſt care moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially for their ſoules and bodies in the life to come. They then are greatly deceiued, who when they haue giuen them meate and Money, thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſufficiently diſcharged. If we onely feede them and fill them to the full, what doe we more to them then to our brute Beaſts? If we onely cloath them and pay them their wages, <note n="r" place="margin">Math. 5, 20.</note> what doe wee more to them then the Turkes and Infidels that feare not God, that know not God, doe performe to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Seruants? If we thinke our ſelues diſcharged by prouiding for them, and leauing vnto them a temporall patrimony and poſſeſſion, and neuer regard to make them heires and Inheritors of the Kingdome of Heauen, what do we more then the Iewes or Gentiles, that are ignorant of Chriſt and his Goſpell? What ſhould it auaile vs or them, to leaue them rich in the World, and poore in God? To lay vp for them treaſures on earth, and to neglect the treaſures of Heauen, which are the true and enduring ſubſtance? True it is, Fathers and Mothers are bound concerning this bodily life, to make honeſt prouiſion for the ſuſtenance of their Children; and therefore all vnthrifty Dicers and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards which waſt and waſh away their goods (whoſe Children may well bee accounted fatherleſſe, and their Wiues as Widdowes) haue no <note n="ſ" place="margin">1 Tim. 5, 8.</note> ſpark or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of naturall Fathers in them: neuertheleſſe, they are charged, not onelie to bring them vp in the World, but to prepare them for the World to come. It is a vaine and fooliſh imagination to dreame that wee haue done our part, or diſcharged a Fathers and a Mothers duty, when we haue nouriſhed, appartel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and brought vp our Children, whereas wee haue a farre greater account to make before God for their ſoules. They are alſo greatly deceiued, who if they ſend them to the Church on the Sabbaoth day, and bring them to the place of Gods worſhip, they thinke they haue anſwered the charge required of them. Theſe men poſt ouer all their dutie to the Miniſter, and lay the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then (to eaſe themſelues) vpon his ſhoulders. They care not, they ſpare not to lay load vpon anothers backe, that they may not beare it, or touch it with their little finger. But God cannot thus be mocked or deluded, or defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, who commaunded that themſelues ſhould rehearſe his Lawes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements to their Children and Houſholds.</p>
               <p>Indeed, it is a commendable duty to ſee that they ſerue God, and to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany them vnto the houſe of God; but this is onelie halfe (if halfe) our dutie, or rather to do our dutie to halues; we muſt both prouide that they may bee taught, and alſo teach them our ſelues: when the Miniſter hath planted, wee muſt water: when he hath preached, wee muſt ſee how they profit, and by all
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7222:34"/> meanes aſſiſt him in the worke of the Lord. They are alſo greatly deceiued, who take themſelues to be diſcharged of their duty, when they haue taught them to ſay the ten Commaundements, the Lords Prayer, and the Creede, or the Articles of Faith, becauſe they ſay they haue done what they can, and are able to performe no more. If they can doe no more, it is a ſhame for them that they will be Fathers, before they can doe that which is the duty of fathers. It is one thing to teach them to ſay them; another to vnderſtand them. It is not enough for vs to helpe them to ſpeake the wordes, vnleſſe wee labour to make them conceiue the meaning of the wordes. The Commaundements of the Law, and the petitions of the Lords Prayer ſtand not in the bare wordes, but in the true meaning. Let them know therefore, that they muſt render a greater account then of teaching them to vtter and pronounce the wordes, they muſt cauſe them to vnderſtand them, they muſt ſow the Seedes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion in their hearts, they muſt inſtruct them with all diligence, they muſt exhort them with all earneſtneſſe; they muſt charge them to feare God, and to walk in his waies: that ſo their children may be made Gods Children, and ſo giue them to him againe, of whom, and by whoſe bleſſing, at the firſt they receiued them.</p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 2.</note> Secondly, ſeeing all Houſholders muſt teach their families, it is their duty firſt of all to reforme themſelues, that ſo their people may be reformed. They that are the chiefe in the Family, muſt looke vnto themſelues, and goe in and out before them by good example, that ſo they may the better looke vnto thoſe that are vnder them. It is a Teſtimony of our great loue toward them, and an earneſt deſire to win them to the truth, and to embrace true godlineſſe, when we ſeek to ſaue their ſoules. He that loueth the ſoule, <note n="t" place="margin">
                     <hi>Plutar. in Alcibia.</hi>
                  </note> loueth truely: for the foule is the principall part of man. They therefore that are careleſſe in training vp their children in religion, cannot aſſure themſelues that they bear any true loue vnto them. Let them ſhew neuer ſo much comfort &amp; compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their bodies, yet all their mercies are cruell, ſo long as they neglect the chiefeſt care that ought to be in them toward their ſoules. We may iudge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be more inhumaine and vnnaturall, euen more then ſauage beaſts, who not onely by neglect of teaching their Children the feare of the Lord, but by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt example of liuing do lead them into euill, and ſo murther their ſoules. For how many children in ſtead of good education and godly inſtruction, do heare their Fathers delight in ſwearing, doe ſee them deale deceitfully and vniuſtly, and walke in euerie euill way? If wee ſhould beholde a man killing his owne children, and laying violent hands vpon his owne fleſh, if wee ſhould ſee him deſtroy his poſterity, and ſhed the innocent blood of thoſe that came out of his owne loines: who would not accuſe and condemne him of vnnatural mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and barbarous cruelty? But there are many, many thouſand Fathers in the world that are the Murtherers and Butchers; yea, the death and deſtruction of their owne Iſſue. They gaue them life, but they are the cauſes of their death. They gaue them a temporall being, but they bring them to eternall condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. They ſhould direct them in the right way to Heauen, but they leade them into the pathes of ſinne, and ſo thruſt them downe to Hell with their owne handes. For ſo long as we teach them not to honour God, but to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour him, and regard not whether they know Chriſt Ieſus or not, but are patternes and preſidents vnto them of all prophaneneſſe, wee are guilty of their blood, and are worſe then thoſe that take away their naturall life, and ſhall one day holde vp our hand at the barre of Gods Iudgement, to bee ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned for it. For they onelie kill the bodie, and when they haue done, can do no more: but we caſt away and ſpill the Soules of our Children, which is the greateſt rigour, the vileſt murther, and the extreameſt crueltie in the world. If therefore we would be cleere and pure from the bloud of our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, let vs traine them vp in godlineſſe, and take heed to our ſelues, reforming
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7222:34"/> our owne waies, and endeuouring to bee examples vnto them in all holineſſe and true righteouſneſſe. This is it which <hi>Ioſhua</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Ioſh. 24, 15.</note> profeſſeth in his exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he maketh to the people, that they would with full purpoſe of heart cleaue vnto the Lord. <hi>Ioſhua</hi> 24. 15. <hi>If it ſeeme euill vnto you to ſerue the Lorde, chuſe you this day whom you will ſerue, whether the Gods which your Fathers ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued beyond the floud, or the Gods of the Amorites, in whoſe Land ye dwell: but I and my houſe will ſerue the Lord.</hi> The like we ſee in the aunſwere of Queene <hi>Eſter</hi> to <hi>Mordecai,</hi> when ſhee had exhorted to gather the Church together to Faſting and Prayer, that God might be intreated to open a way for their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance <note n="x" place="margin">Eſter 4, 16.</note> ſhe addeth; <hi>I and my Maids will doe likewiſe.</hi> A like practiſe we find in <hi>Dauid.

It is no ſmall praiſe of the houſe of <hi>Philemon,</hi> that he had ſo taught and inſtructed his Family, that hee had the liuely Image and true repreſentation of a Church in it, diſcharging after a ſort, the duty of a Paſtor within his owne walles. So the Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> ſaluteth <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcilla,</hi> 
                  <note n="z" place="margin">Rom. 16, 3, 5 and 1 Cor. 16, 19.</note> and the Church that is in their houſe. Euery Gouernour of an houſe, and Maiſter of a Family muſt endeuour, that his houſe-hold may deſerue the Name of a Church. He ſhould be the ſpeaker, they the hearers: he the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour, they the flocke: he the Miniſter, they the people: hee ready to inſtruct, they ready to be inſtructed. A priuate Family, ſhould be as a priuate ſchoole, the Gouernour is the Maiſter of the Schoole: euery one within his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a Scholler to learne of him.</p>
               <p>This ſhall bee a ſinguler commendation vnto vs, if we ſo order our ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall charges and places of gouernment, as that they may bee called rather Churches, then priuate Families: rather Schooles, then Houſes: rather Temples of GOD, then dwellings of men: rather Tabernacles ſet vp to ſerue the Lord, then buildings erected to ſerue our ſelues. Now wee ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to this praiſe and eſtimation among the faithfull, if our houſes doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble Churches, by the practiſe of ſuch exerciſes as are performed in it. For the Maiſter is both a King and a Paſtor within his owne houſe: a King, to rule and correct: a Paſtor, to inſtruct and reprooue; yea, to remooue ſuch as are obſtinate and obdurate. Let vs therefore all of vs ſet vp little Churches in our houſes: let vs vſe in them prayer to God, Catechizing of our youth, teaching of the ignorant, reading of the Scriptures, ſinging of Pſalmes, conferring one with another, examining of our people, <note n="a" place="margin">Math. 13, 51</note> taking an account how they profite, comforting them that are weak, encouraging them that are willing, diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing them that are froward and vntoward, ſhewing gentleneſſe vnto all, ſuffering the euill, and inſtructing them with meekeneſſe that are contrary minded.</p>
               <p>Thus doing, we ſhall beginne a Church in our houſes, we ſhall erect a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Tabernacle vnto God, and giue to thoſe that liue with vs, and depend vppon vs, an entrance into the Kingdome of Heauen. But alaſſe, May wee ſpeake and write to many Maiſters in our times, as <hi>Paule</hi> doth in this place to <hi>Philemon?</hi> May we truly call their priuate houſes little Churches, by reaſon of the exerciſes of Religion vſed in them? Nay, I would to God, there were not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7222:35"/> great multitudes ſwarming among vs, which haue ſuch diſſolute and diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red houſes, ſo farre from being Images and likeneſſes of a Church, that they are liuely pictures of the prophane World, and very repreſentations of the Kingdome of darkneſſe, and of the bottomleſſe pit of Hell. Theſe men, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they ſhroude themſelues vnder the names of Chriſtians, and would bee accounted faithfull men, yet it is manifeſt, that they are farre from true Chriſtianitie, and from a godly and religious minde. For ſhall they bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed ſound and ſincere <note n="b" place="margin" type="runSum">What the houſes of the vngodly are.</note> Chriſtians, that ſuffer their Families to bee full of ſwearing, lying, railing, royſting, quarrelling, contention, and all other wickedneſſe, and neuer goe about to examine them, or exhort them to any goodneſſe? So that it is a very hell to dwell in them, a very death to liue in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a loathſome and ſtinking perſon to remaine in them; yea, a foule and filthy lakes to abide in them, wherein all vnſauoury and vnſeaſoned practiſes, are contained and continued. I dare boldly auouch, and conſtantly defend, that a man were farre better to thruſt his Sonne into a Peſt-houſe, or place of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, then to commit him to ſuch Maiſters of miſrule, and teachers of all ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations, moſt noyſome and dangerous to Soule and Bodie, where thoſe corruptions are quickly learned, which are afterward hardly forgotten, and bred in the bone, which are not eaſily remooued out of the fleſh. We vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and commonly ſay of him that liueth in a contagious place, Lorde haue mercy vpon him: but much rather, and farre better may wee ſay and pray for ſuch as are in leud and vngodly houſes, Lord be mercifull vnto them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer them from euill. For if the plague and peſtilence walke among vs, and we among them, they can but kill the body, and make an end of this Mortall life: but the contagion of ſinne will bring fearefull deſtruction, both vppon Soule and Body, and will root out whole Houſes and Families, waſt Townes and Citties, and conſume vtterly Countries and Kingdomes. We ſee how by the inſtinct of Nature, Parents haue a care to place their Children, where they may be well vſed, and where they may bee well prouided for, that they want nothing: but what folly is this to looke to the body, and to haue no reſpect to the Soule? To be curious in the leaſt, and careleſſe in the principall thing? To ſee that the backe bee cloathed and the belly filled, and neuer require or inquire how the ſoule (which is the chiefeſt part) bee prouided for and ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? To be angry if they want food for this life, and yet to ſeeme pleaſed and contented, though they neuer taſt of that bread and of that meat, which indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to euerlaſting life.</p>
               <p>It hath alwaies beene otherwiſe with faithfull Gouernours and Chriſtian Parents, they haue made conſcience of their duties to God and their Families. It is noted touching <hi>Iacob,</hi> when hee was to goe to <hi>Bethell</hi> the houſe of God, <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 35, 2.</note> he ſanctified and prepared his people, he reformed and redreſſed the abuſes that were crept in among them, before they came to the worſhip of God. <hi>Abraham</hi> had in his houſe three hundred and eighteene perſons which hee had well inſtructed, <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 14, 14.</note> who were ready to aduenture their liues with him in the battell. The Apoſtle giueth this commendation to <hi>Timothy, That he had knowne the Scriptures of a Childe, who are able to make him wiſe vnto ſaluation,</hi>

Our gouernment therefore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer others, muſt not be a meete ciuill gouernment (as the gouernment of moſt men is) but a religious gouernment, to feede the ſoule as well as the bodie, to prouide for the life to come, as well as for this preſent life.</p>

How many are there among vs that haue a care to come to this place themſelues, that haue no conſcience to looke to their Children, whoſe ſaluation ſhould bee as deare, and as much deſired as their owne?

                  <hi>When I remembred theſe thinges, I powred out my very heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had gone with the multitude, and led them into the houſe of God with the voice of ſinging and praiſe, as a multitude that keepeth a Feaſt.</hi> Behold heere, the godly deuotion of a religious heart, as the Hart brayeth for the Riuers of Waters, ſo his ſoule panted after God and his publike worſhip: neither could he content himſelfe to goe alone, but it was his comfort and delight, to leade others as it were by the hand with him, that they might finde that ſweeteneſſe in the word that hee found, and be partakers of the benefit that hee reaped thereby.</p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 5.</note> Laſtly, ſeeing it is ſo neceſſary a duty to teach our Houſholds, we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that it is as neceſſary for Children and Seruants to bee taught and inſtructed. It ſhould be therefore our care and deſire, to dwell and inhabite in ſuch places and houſes, as that we may be trained vp in godlineſſe, and learn our duties to God and man. It ſhould bee our care and deſire to place and beſtow our Children with ſuch perſons, as that they may be brought vp in the feare of God. There is not one of thoſe in our Families, euen the loweſt and meaneſt, but of meate, drinke, cloathing, or wages, bee at any times denyed or detained from them, they will thinke themſelues wronged and miſuſed, and are ready to complaine of the iniury. How much more (if there were in them any care of their Soules, or loue of the life to come) would they mourn and lament when they are debarred and defrauded of this moſt neceſſary por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (the knowledge of true Religion) appointed by the Lord to be beſtowed vpon them. If a man be to take any Farme, he will not doe it hand ouer head, but he will know what Acres hee ſhall haue, what arable ground, what Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and what meanes of his maintenance: but how many are there that ſeek to others for their ſeruice, who neuer conſider what inſtruction they ſhal haue,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7222:36" rendition="simple:additions"/> or whether they be likely euer to hear of the Name of God? There is no Man ſo ſimple in wit, but if he put his Sonne to bee an Apprentize, and his Maiſter within his yeares doe not teach him his occupation, hee will and may iuſtlie thinke his Childe much miſvſed: what a wonderfull blindneſſe and blockiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe then doth it argue in them, that care not where they put, and with whom they place their Children, ſo they learne their occupation, they regard not whether they learne any Religion, and neuer enquire whether their Maiſters take any pains or not, to teach them the precepts and inſtructions that belong to a Chriſtian, which of all callings vnder heauens, is both the moſt honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and in the end, ſhall be acknowledged to bee moſt profitable. Let vs therefore put out our Children to bee the Seruants of thoſe, that may learne them to be the Seruants of God. Let vs ſo binde them to their Trade, that we may be ſure they may learne the Trade of Trades, the Art of Arts, the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of Myſteries; that is, Religion and Godlineſſe. If wee haue little to leaue our Children, and ſmall wealth to bequeath vnto them, yet if we bring them vp to this Trade, and binde them faſt vnto it, we ſhall leaue them a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and wealthy portion: for all men muſt bee of this Trade. We ſee how coſtly other Trades are, and what a round ſumme muſt be giuen with our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to ſerue for them: but we may <note n="k" place="margin">Eſay 55, 1, 2.</note> without coſt, and without Mony, make our Children of this Trade, which is the beſt and moſt gainefull of all others. <note n="l" place="margin">1 Tim. 6, 6.</note>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The order of the words, and the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame.</note> Hitherto wee haue ſpoken of the firſt part of the Praeface of this Epiſtle, touching the perſons writing and written vnto: Now we come to the ſecond part; to wit, the prayers which he maketh, which are of two ſortes: a ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a thankſgiuing: the ſalutation is a greeting, which the Apoſtle wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to all the perſons before named, wherein we are to conſider two pointes; firſt, what bleſſings the Apoſtle deſireth to be giuen vnto them. Secondlie, from whom he craueth them. The bleſſings which he prayeth for, are two; namely, <hi>Grace and Peace.</hi> By Grace, we muſt vnderſtand the free fauour, meer mercy, and good will of God towards vs, whereby he hath eternally &amp; vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruedly loued vs in Chriſt, who are a people by nature not beloued, but deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to be diſgraced by him, and hated of him. The ſecond bleſſing that he beggeth for them, is peace, whereby is meant all kind of benefits, ſpirituall and temporall, which flow vnto vs from this Fountaine, and grow out of the root of grace; and therefore ordinarily in other Epiſtles, it is annexed vnto it. Grace heere mnntioned, is not any gift in vs, but it is Gods, and in God; it is his gratious fauour, free loue, and good will, whereby he is well pleaſed with his elect, in, and for Chriſt. Peace, is not any guift in God, but in vs, and is that holy vnity and bleſſed concord, which is in the Kingdome of God among Gods Children: this concord and agreement of Gods Children, is a fruit and effect of grace. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Paraphr.</note> So then, the meaning of the words is this; We wiſh vnto you all the fauour of God in Chriſt, and that concord which is propper to Gods Church and Children, hauing peace with God, with his holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, with his Church, with your owne hearts, with your enemies, and with al his Creatures.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:7222:36"/>
               <p>Secondly, in this verſe is ſet downe the cauſe, the worker, and author from whom theſe bleſſings come; to wit, the Father, and Ieſus Chriſt. God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Fountaine of them; and Chriſt our Lord, as the Cunduit pipe, by whom they are carried and conueied vnto vs. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiect.</note> But it may be obiected, why is the holy Ghoſt left out? why is not he named? do not theſe guifts come from him as well as from the Father and the Son? <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwer.</note> I anſwer, It is a generall rule in all Arts, and true in Diuinity; That which is vnderſtood is not wanting. So then, the holy Ghoſt, the third perſon in Trinity is not omitted, though not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: for he muſt of neceſſity be vnderſtood, who proceedeth from them both; namely, from the Father and the Sonne. Chriſt ſaith in his <note n="m" place="margin">Iohn 17.</note> Prayer. <hi>This is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life, to know thee to be the onely true God, and whom thou haſt ſent Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> yet the holy Ghoſt in this place, is not excluded from both the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but included and comprehended together with them, for theſe three are one, <note n="n" place="margin">Iohn 5.</note> as the Apoſtle teacheth. Thus much touching the order and meaning of the words: Now let vs proceede to the obſeruations out of the ſame, and then come to the Doctrines.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obſeruations out of this ver.</note> The obſeruations out of this verſe, containing the ſalutation, are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which we will point out. Firſt of all, we ſee the matter of his Prayer what it is; he asketh not the fauour of Men, but of God: he craueth not earthly and worldly peace, but ſpirituall and heauenly. True it is, the fauour and good will of Men, the outward peace and tranquilitie one with another, are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and excellent guiftes, but the free and fatherly fauour of God, together with peace with GOD the Father, beeing reconciled vnto vs in his deare Sonne, are much to be preferred in our deſires. Heereby wee haue that peace <note n="o" place="margin">Phil. 4, 7.</note> of conſcience which paſſeth all vnderſtanding, which teacheth vs to reſt in God as in a moſt louing Father, with all confidence and aſſurance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as wee learne cheefelie to aske ſpirituall bleſſings, ſo wee ſee what bleſsings among ſuch as are ſpirituall, are the principall and predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; to wit, the fauour of God and peace of conſcience. He that is poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of theſe two, hath an hid Mine of Treaſures, with which, all the Wealth and Riches of the World are not to bee compared vnto. For theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are heauenly, are ſpirituall, are eternall: whereas the ſubſtance of this World is Temporall, is Tranſitorie, is corruptible. The Worlde it ſelfe muſt paſſe and vaniſh away, and all theſe earthly things muſt decay and periſh with it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtle in ſome of his Epiſtles, vſeth three wordes; <note n="p" place="margin">1 Tim. 1, 2. and 2 Tim 1, 2. &amp; 2 Iohn 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Grace, Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Peace:</hi> heere hee contenteth himſelfe with naming two, Grace and Peace, omitting and leauing out Mercy: wherein there is no contrariety or diuerſity, for as much as Mercy is included vnder Peace. For by Mercy is vnderſtood our Iuſtification, which conſiſteth partly in the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, and partly in the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, which do bring true peace with them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we ſee from whom hee asketh all theſe; to wit, firſt from God the Father, to teach that he is the Authour of euery good giuing and perfect guift. If then we ſtand in neede of them, we muſt goe to him, we muſt aske them of him, we can receiue them of none but of him, <note n="q" place="margin">Iam. 1, 5, 17</note> as the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> teacheth.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, we ſee that to God the Father he ioyneth Ieſus Chriſt: for all bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are beſtowed vpon vs through Chriſt, the Mediator of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. God the Father is the Fountaine, Chriſt is the Pipe or Cunduit, by whom they are conueied vnto vs. He that hath not him, hath not the Father. Hee that is not in him, remaineth in death. Hence it is that the Euangeliſt ſaith; <note n="r" place="margin">Iohn 3, 36.</note> 
                  <hi>He that beleeueth in the Sonne, hath euerlaſting life, and hee that obeyeth not the Sonne, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, obſerue the Title giuen vnto him, he is called the Lord of his Church:
<pb facs="tcp:7222:37" rendition="simple:additions"/> it is a Kingdome, whereof he is the Prince: it is a Citty, whereof he is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor: it is an houſe, whereof he is the Maiſter: it is a body, whereof he is the head. So then, all obedience is due to him, and all men (how great ſoeuer) muſt acknowledge his Lordſhip ouer them. Laſtly, in that he craueth grace and peace from Chriſt our Lord, as well as from God the Father, it confirmeth our Faith in a Fundamentall point of Chriſtian Religion, touching the Deity of Chriſt; <note n="n" place="margin">Phil. 2, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Who is GOD equall with, the Father;</hi> againſt the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and other Heretiques that deny his Eternity. For ſeeing hee giueth grace and peace as well as the Father, we conclude him to be true God Co-eternall, and Co-equall with the Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">[<hi>Grace, &amp;c.</hi>]</q> This word in the Scripture hath two ſignifications, the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance whereof hath bred great errour, and be one the occaſion of ſtumbling in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Firſt, it ſignifieth Gods good will and fauour: Secondlie, ſome guift of God freely beſtowed, which is grace of his grace: and ſo the <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 5, 15.</note> Apoſtle doth diſtinguiſh the grace of God from the gift that is by grace. In this place, we muſt vnderſtand, not any particular gift of God infuſed into vs, as faith, hope, loue, and ſuch like; but the free fauour and loue of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he accepteth of ſome in Chriſt for his owne Children: for wee ſee heere, it is diſcerned and diſtinguiſhed from peace, which is a guift of Grace, and therefore cannot ſignifie the ſame thing. This grace and good will of God, is the Fountaine of all Gods bleſſings, and the foundation of all mans happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. All that we haue is of Grace, it is the beginning of all good thinges in vs. Our <note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 11, 5. 2 Tim. 1, 9. Rom, 3, 24. Ezek. 36, 27. Ephe. 2, 10. Rom. 6, 23.</note> Election, Redemption, Vocation, Iuſtification, Sanctification, &amp; Glorification is of grace onely, we can aſcribe nothing to our ſelues. Now in this Diuine Salutation, and Apoſtolicall Benediction, mark that the Apoſtle beginneth with this grace. <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The free fauor of God is of vs chiefely to be deſired.</note> From hence we learne, that the fauour of God is to be ſought for aboue all other thinges. The free grace and vndeſerued loue of God, is the firſt, and higheſt, and onely cauſe of all bleſſings, is aboue al things to be deſired and intreated at the hands of God. Conſider the example of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid. Pſal.</hi> 4. <hi>Many ſay,</hi> 
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Pſal. 4, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>who will ſhew vs any good? But Lord lift thou vp the light of thy countenance vpon me.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, let worldly men ſeek what they will, and let them place their happineſſe in riches, pleaſures, and vanities, but my deſire is after thy loue and fauour aboue all. Hence it is, that he calleth and accounteth God his portion, <note n="r" place="margin">Pſal. 16, 5. &amp; 18, 2.</note> his lot, his inheritance, his rocke, his refuge, his ſhield, and Caſtle of defence; to ſhew, that all his ioy was in Gods fauour, all his comfort in Gods loue, and that he preferred his grace before all thinges in the world beſides. This affection is alſo expreſſed in the 73. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 
                  <note n="ſ" place="margin">Pſal. 73, 25, 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Whom haue I in heauen but thee? And I haue deſired none in the earth with thee: my fleſh faileth, and mine hart alſo, but God is the ſtrength of mine heart, and my portion for euer.</hi> So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> accounteth all thinges as loſſe and dung in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the grace of God. Whereby we ſee, that all men ſhould principally, and in the firſt place, ſeeke, wiſh, and intreat for the feeling of Gods fauour in Chriſt, as the bleſſed Fountaine of all good things to come vpon vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 1.</note> Let vs conſider the cauſes and Reaſons of this point. Firſt, one drop of his free loue, is better worth then all the World, and it ſhall yeelde vs more ſweet and ſound comfort in the latter end. If we ſhould put the grace of God and the glory of the world, and peize them together in the ballances, the leaſt dramme and drop of the fauour of God toward vs, would ouer-weigh, and ouer-ſway all the whole World, and all the thinges that are in the World, which worldly men make their chiefeſt Treaſure. This the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> found by experience, ſo ſoone as he had prayed for the louing countenance of GOD, hee addeth; <note n="t" place="margin">Pſal. 4, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou haſt giuen me more ioy of heart, then they haue had, when their Wheate and their Wine did abound.</hi> This giueth a man more ſound comfort, then hee can finde elſe-where. Wee haue a common ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that runneth in euery Mans mouth, Giue a man good lucke, and throw
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7222:37"/> him into the Sea. But this is a Diuine truth, Let a man haue the free Grace and fauour of GOD, and then neyther Sea nor Land; neither Fire nor Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; neyther Sword nor Peſtilence; neyther force nor Famine; neyther any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing ſhall be able to hurt him. We ſee this <note n="e" place="margin">Exod. 14, 30.</note> in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi> when they were come to the Red Sea, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> with his Army fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed at their backes, they were brought through the Sea as on dry Land, and were carried ſafely in the Wilderneſſe as on Eagles Winges by the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and protection of God. The three Children <note n="f" place="margin">Dan. 3, 27, &amp; 6, 22.</note> were caſt into the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>Daniell</hi> was thrown into the Lyons denne: yet they were not conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the Fire, neyther he deuoured by the Lyons. This made the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſay; <note n="g" place="margin">Pſal. 23, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Though I ſhould walke through the Valley of the ſhaddow of death, I will feare none ill: for thou art with me, thy Rodde, and thy Staffe, they comfort me.</hi> All other comfort is no better then diſcomfort; all other ioy is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then ſorrow and vexation of Spirit without this; according to the ſaying of the Wiſe-man: <note n="h" place="margin">Eccle. 2, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>I ſaid of laughter, Thou art mad; and of ioy, what is this that thou doſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 2.</note> Secondly, the grace and loue of God, bleſſeth, ſanctifieth, and furthereth all other thinges vnto vs, honour, wealth: wiſedome, riches, ſtrength, fauour, friendſhip, and whatſoeuer befall the Sonnes of Men. The Prophet teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 45. Becauſe God had bleſſed him for euer, <note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 45, 2, 3.</note> therefore it is ſaid vnto him, proſper thou with thy glory, ride vppon the word of truth, and of meekeneſſe. On the other ſide, the want of the loue and grace of God, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all other things vnto vs; yea, defileth and poyſoneth them, and maketh them deadly, our honour it turneth into ſhame, our ſtrength into weakeneſſe, our wiſedome into fooliſhneſſe, our riches into ſnares, our beauty into vanity, our ſauour into hatred. We haue many examples in the word of God, and by daily experience offered vnto vs of this truth, the wiſedome of <hi>Achitophell,</hi> the honour of <hi>Haman,</hi> the valour of <hi>Ioab,</hi> the beauty of <hi>Abſolom,</hi> the knowledge of <hi>Iudas,</hi> all theſe were good and great bleſſings of God, but all are turned to be curſſes vnto them, becauſe wanting the free grace of GOD, they wanted the ſanctified vſe of them. Seeing therefore, the loue of God is of greater price, and more excellent value then all the world, and ſeeing his grace ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth and ſeaſoneth all other bleſſings, and the want thereof bringeth a curſſe vpon them, wee conclude and gather from theſe reaſons, that the free fauour and mercy of God in Chriſt Ieſus, is firſt and aboue all other things, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated and deſired for our ſelues and others.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</note> Now let vs make vſe of this point. Firſt, let euerie one of vs ſeeke to haue our hearts eſtabliſhed and ſetled in this free grace, to finde and feele in vs his loue ſhed in our hearts by his holy Spirit. Let this bee our firſt, our chiefe, our principall and ſpecial care, to obtaine the loue and fauour of God, that wee may be beloued of him. This was the prayer of the Prophet, <note n="k" place="margin">Pſal. 51, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Reſtore to me the ioy of thy ſaluation, and ſtabliſh me with thy free Spirit.</hi> So the Apoſtle teacheth; <note n="l" place="margin">Hebr. 13, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>It is a good thing that the heart bee ſtabliſhed with grace.</hi> We ſee how men are filled and carryed away with naturall preſumption, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from their Cradle, perſwading themſelues to ſtand in a ſure eſtate, and thinking to eſcape the wrath of God: but of this free grace they haue no taſt, no deſire, no feeling of any want. They imagine themſelues to ſtand in no neede thereof, they preſume they are in the fauour of God; they dreame that he cannot chuſe but loue them. If we want any earthlie bleſſing, the helpe of Friendes, the health of bodie, the Treaſure of this World, we can very quickly feele it, our ſenſes are ſharpe enough to diſcerne it: but though we want the grace of God and his fauour toward vs, wee haue no more fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling then dead Men hath, wee neyther feele it, nor deſire it, nor once regard it.</p>
               <p>We ſpend our ſtrength, waſt our life, and conſume our daies in ſeeking riches,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7222:38"/> honours, pleaſures, and preferments, but wee neuer looke ſo high as to the grace of God. We lye groueling like the Beaſtes vpon the Earth, wee vſe euery day; nay, euery houre, nay, euerie minute, the bleſsings of God, <note n="f" place="margin">Acts 17, 28.</note> 
                  <hi>In whom we liue, and mooue, and haue our being:</hi> yet wee will not lift vp our eyes to the chiefe cauſe of all, the Grace of God. Let vs therefore aboue all thinges, ſeeke earneſtly for the grace of God, wherein the Foundation of all our happineſſe is laid. He that liueth in his fauour, hath comfort in all ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and miſeries. He that dyeth out of his fauour, dyeth as a Beaſt; nay, worſe then a beaſt, and ſhall haue fellowſhip with the Deuill and his Angels, it had beene good if ſuch a one had neuer beene borne. For euen as the rich man in the Goſpell, deſired <note n="g" place="margin">Luke 16, 24</note> one drop of Water to quench the fire, and to coole his tongue, and if he might haue gotten it, hee would haue preferred it before the gaining and obtaining of a thouſand Worlds: ſo when God ſhall ſet our ſinnes in order before vs, and the Gulfe of his wrath ready to ſwallow vs, we ſhall cry out for one drop of Grace, for one drop of Faith, for one drop of comfort, to refreſh our pining Soules, and to deliuer vs from the ſhaddow of death.</p>
               <p>Now is the time to deſire and ſeeke after grace, if we let ſlip the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion offered vnto vs, we ſhall afterward cry out for it, and complaine of the want of it, and yet ſhall neuer attaine vnto it. Thus was it with the rich Man, when he entreated <hi>Abraham to haue mercy on him, and to ſend Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, that he might dip the tip of his Finger in Water to coole his tongue, beeing tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in that Flame: Abraham</hi> anſwered; <hi>Sonne, remember that thou in thy life time receiuedſt thy pleaſures, and likewiſe Lazarus paines: now therefore hee is comforted, and thou art tormented.</hi> Thus was it with the fooliſh Virgins who ſlumbred and ſlept, and regarded not to procure and prouide Oyle <note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 25, 10, 11.</note> for their Lampes: for when the Bridegroome was come and had ſhut the Gate, they cryed in vaine, <hi>Lord, Lord, open vnto vs,</hi> who receiued their anſwere, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, I ſay vnto you, I know you not.</hi> Thus it ſhall be with thoſe in the laſt day, which ſhall ſay; <note n="i" place="margin">Math. 7, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord, Lord, haue we not in thy Name propheſied? And by thy Name caſt out Deuils? And by thy Name done many great workes? For then hee will profeſſe vnto them, he neuer knew them, depart from me ye workers of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> So ſhall it be with thoſe that haue neglected the time, and paſſed ouer the opportunity, <note n="k" place="margin">Luke 14, 25 26.</note> who begin to ſay, <hi>Lord, open vnto vs, we haue eaten and drunke in thy preſence, and thou haſt taught in our Streets:</hi> to whom he ſhall ſay, <hi>I know you not whence ye are.</hi> Let vs all be wiſe, and beware by their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that we do not delay the time from day to day. Let vs craue this guift of God, that we may haue it in time of neede, and in the houre of tentation. If now while we haue time, we ſhall deſire and labour to obtaine grace, wee ſhall not neede heereafter to ſtand in feare of Death, or to cry out through horror and deſpaire! O that I had one drop of Faith! O that I had one drop of Grace.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 2.</note> Secondly, ſeeing grace is in the firſt place, aboue and before all other bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to be deſired and required at the handes of God, let vs learne the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and enter into the beaten path that leadeth to this Grace, and when wee haue learned it, let vs walke in it, in a conſtant and ſetled courſe. Now the ſteppes <note n="l" place="margin" type="runSum">Three ſteps leading vs to finde Gods grace.</note> that wee muſt make to trace it, and finde it out, are theſe. The firſt degree or ſteppe, is to diſlike our ſelues, and to bee in diſgrace with our ſelues. Euery man naturally, is in loue with himſelfe, and his owne ſhadow. But wee muſt caſt off this ſelfe-loue, that cleaueth ſo faſt and hangeth on, and learne to know our ſelues, and to hate our ſelues.</p>
               <p>No man can magnifie Gods mercy ſufficiently, vntill hee attaine to the knowledge of his owne miſery. <hi>Daniell,</hi> a man gratious and dearely beloued of GOD acknowledged this in his prayer, and as it were aſcendeth into the preſence of God by this ſteppe, <note n="m" place="margin">Dan. 9, 7, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>O Lord, righteouſneſſe belongeth vnto thee,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7222:38"/> and vnto vs open ſhame, as appeareth this day, to our Kings, to our Princes, to our Fathers, and vnto euery Man of Iudah, becauſe we haue ſinned againſt thee.</hi> This was the courſe that the Prodigall Sonne tooke, and the way that he entred, <note n="g" place="margin">Luke 15, 21</note> 
                  <hi>Father, I haue ſinned againſt Heauen and before thee, and am no more worthy to bee called thy Sonne.</hi> Thus did the poore Publican inſinuate himſelfe into the grace of God, and departed iuſtifyed in his ſight, he ſmote his breaſt, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <note n="h" place="margin">Luke 18, 13</note> 
                  <hi>Lord, be mercifull to me a Sinner.</hi> To be proud, and puffed vp with our owne righteouſneſſe, and to truſt in our owne wiſedome, is the fore-runner of a fall.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſtep to obtaine grace, is, after we haue felt this want and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery in our ſelues, wee muſt not reſt there, but earneſtly deſire, and inwardly hunger and thirſt after the loue and fauour of God in Chriſt, aboue all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinges. Firſt, we muſt feele our ſelues empty, before our Soules can haue this hunger. Our Sauiour deſcribing true bleſſedneſſe to his Diſciples, and ſhewing wherein it conſiſteth contrary to the iudgement of the World, hee ſaith; <note n="i" place="margin">Math. 5, 3, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed are the poore in Spirit;</hi> that is, that know themſelues poore, that feele themſelues poore and voide of righteouſneſſe: and then he addeth, <hi>Bleſſed are they which hunger and thirst after righteouſneſſe, for they ſhall be filled.</hi> We muſt <note n="k" place="margin">Iohn 6, 27. and 4, 14.</note> hunger after the meat that neuer periſheth: wee muſt thirſt after that Well of Water which ſpringeth vp vnto euerlaſting life. If wee neuer hunger after grace, we ſhall neuer haue grace. <hi>The whole deſire</hi> 
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Math. 9, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>not the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, but they that are ſicke: They</hi>

                  <hi>which thinke they ſee, are made blind, and their ſinne remaineth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, it is required of vs, to lay hould by the hand of a true Faith, vpon the grace and mercy of God in Chriſt Ieſus, offered vnto all of vs in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Goſpell generally, and learne to apply them to our ſelues parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly. Chriſt calleth thoſe <note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 11, 28.</note> that are weary and heauy laden, promiſing to eaſe end refreſh them. In the laſt and great day of the Feaſt, Ieſus ſtood and cryed, ſaying; <note n="o" place="margin">Iohn 7, 37.</note> 
                  <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come vnto me and drinke.</hi> He teacheth; <note n="p" place="margin">Mark 16, 16</note> 
                  <hi>That he that ſhall beleeue and be Baptized, ſhall be ſaued.</hi> Theſe are generall promiſes, theſe require particular application. Wee cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them into our hearts, and make them our owne, except we lay houlde of them by a ſpeciall Faith. This liuely Faith, bringeth Chriſt home to vs, and openeth the doores of our Soules to entertaine him. If then we feele our owne miſerie, if we hunger after mercie, and if wee apply the promiſes of the Goſpell to vs particularly, we ſhall be aſſured to finde the grace of God, and taſt plentifully and abundantly of his loue. So many as truely deſire grace, muſt looke to attaine it by theſe meanes, and climb vp to the top of it by theſe ſteps and degrees, as by certaine ſtaires.</p>

We are taught firſt to ſeeke his grace and fauour, as the roote and Fountaine, and then peace, welfare, and other bleſſings. He that will receiue fruit from the tree, muſt come to the roote and body, before he can come to the braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: ſo if we would haue peace, health, wealth, a good name, fauour, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or other gifts of the Spirit, wee muſt begin at the roote; that is, intreat firſt for the grace of God, take hold of his free loue, and aboue all thinges, beg his fatherlie fauour to compaſſe vs, as with a garment, and to defend vs as with a ſhielde. It is in vaine to aske any thing, it is in vaine to hope for, and to expect any bleſſing as a bleſſing, before this be asked and obtained. This order is to be obſerued, if wee would enioy and poſſeſſe Gods bleſsinges. When the grace of God commeth, and maketh vs accepted, it commeth not alone, but commeth accompanied, and bringeth a traine of all other bleſsings with it.</p>
               <p>Hee that will ſeeke a benefite from a Prince, muſt firſt ſeeke to bee gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7222:39"/> with the Prince and get his fauor: he muſt neuer look to be reſpected and regarded in his ſuit, that is out of the Princes fauour: ſo if wee would haue wealth, welfare, eaſe, honour, peace, proſperity, or any other guifts, we muſt before all things, labour to bee gratious with the great God of Heauen, and ſeeke to be accepted in his beloued. This ſerueth to reprooue the prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous courſe of carnall Men, <note n="h" place="margin">

                  <hi>Seeke ye firſt the Kingdome of God and his righteouſneſſe, and all theſe things ſhall be miniſtred vnto you.</hi> If the things of this world be the firſt in our thoughts, the cheefeſt in our deſires, the greateſt in our eſtimation, and the beſt in our imagination, we haue our reward, wee muſt looke for no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at the hands of God.</p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 4.</note> Laſtly, when we haue found our hearts perſwaded, and our Soules poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of this grace of God, let vs delight in it, let vs reſt vpon it, let it bee made our ſtay and comfort in all times, and vpon all occaſions. Let vs remember to be more thankfull to God for it, and more ioyfull in it, <note n="k" place="margin">Eſay 9, 3.</note> then thoſe that reioyce in Harueſt, or ſuch as finde great ſpoiles and rich booties. If thou ſhouldſt finde Mines of Siluer and Gold, and Mountaines of Pearles and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, they could not giue ſuch comfort and contentment vnto thy Soule, as this grace of God is able to doe, which is a Iewell of Iewels. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the man that findeth this Treaſure, and getteth it into his heart, for the <note n="l" place="margin">Pro. 3, 14, 15</note> Marchandize thereof, is better then the Marchandize of Siluer, and the gaine thereof is better then Gold: it is more precious then Pearles, and all thinges that thou canſt deſire, are not to bee compared vnto it. For theſe treaſures of the earth, which worldly men haue in ſo great price and eſtimation, are bought at a deere rate of the owners, but the Lord offereth and giueth his grace frankly and freely vnto vs, which neede the ſame, as we read in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie <note n="m" place="margin">Eſay 55, 5, 1 Iames 1, 2.</note> of <hi>Eſay,</hi> and in the Epiſtle of <hi>Iames.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, the Marchandize of theſe Pearles may be ſtolne from vs, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo ſafely and cloſely lay them vp, but time will conſume them, ruſt will rot them, and Theeues will ſteale them, <note n="n" place="margin">Math. 6, 19</note> as our Sauiour teacheth in the Goſpell: <hi>But the grace of God ſhall neuer dye or decay, but is euer flouriſhing, and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.</hi> Laſtly, the gain of Siluer &amp; Gold, if we could poſſeſſe it in the greateſt meaſure, is but to maintaine the body, and to prouide for this preſent life for a ſeaſon: but the gaining of grace and the fauour of God, is an entituling of vs to the Kingdome of heauen, and to eternall life, which he that hath this grace of God in his heart, ſhall poſſeſſe for euer. Indeed, few men do beleeue this, becauſe they make more reckoning of thinges earthly, then heauenly: but all men ſhall finde it to be true in the end. This treaſure the poore may haue as well as the rich. In all tentations this will ſtand by vs, and raiſe vs vp when we are caſt downe, and ſtrengthen vs when we are weake. This grace (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee are freely beloued) will goe with vs abroad, will ſtay with vs at home, will lye downe with vs in bed, will ſit with vs at Table, will direct vs in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, will ſticke to vs in trouble, will comfort vs in ſickneſſe, will ſolace vs in death, and will accompany vs to heauen. To deſire this, is the beſt coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, and that which onely hath alowance and approbation from God, <note n="o" place="margin">1 Cor. 14, 1</note> and therefore the Apoſtle chargeth vs to couet ſpirituall thinges.

                  <q rend="inline">[<hi>And peace, &amp;c.</hi>]</q> Hitherto we haue ſpoken of the firſt bleſſing, which the Apoſtle craueth for them; to wit, the grace of God, which is the grace of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Now followeth the ſecond, which is peace, which is a notable fruit, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the bleſſed tree of grace. This ſignifieth the quiet concord and vnity, which the faithfull are made partakers of, beeing once ingrafted into Chriſt, and brought into the boſome of the Church.

               <p>Fiftly, we haue peace with our enemies, who are charged not to touch the Lords annointed, and to doe his Prophets no harme. This is ſo farre veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as is expedient to ſet forth the glory of God, to procure the ſafety of the godly, and to repreſſe the rage of the Reprobate.

God is become their Enemy, the Angels are armed to deſtroy them, their owne conſciences conuince and condemne them, the Heauen is ſhut againſt them, death is the gate of Hell vnto them, affliction is a meanes of murmuring in them, the World is a Snare vnto them, Chriſt is a Rocke of offence vnto them, the Goſpell is the fauour of death vnto them, the mercy of God is made a Packe-horſe for their ſinnes, all the ordinances of God are abuſed by them, and all the workes of Gods handes ſhall bee Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their confuſion.

Then they ſhall call to the Hils to couer them, and try to the Mountaines to keepe them from the ſight of God, from the ſeat of his iudgement, and from the fierceneſſe of his wrath and indignation. And as the Apoſtle teacheth, concerning the godly (as we ſhewed before) that all things worke for the beſt to them: ſo we may truely teach on the contrary, that to thoſe which loue not the Lord, nor the Lord them, all thinges turne to their deſtruction, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their condemnation; the Word, the Sacraments, and all other exerciſes of Religion, <note n="u" place="margin">Deut. 32, 15 and 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And if they ſhall peraduenture finde any comfort or conſolation in them, yet what would that auaile them, when their owne conſcience within their owne breaſts, ſhould arraigne them as a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, conuince them as a witneſſe, condemne them as a Iudge, and torment them as an Executioner?

They haue riches, but they are as Vſurpers and as Theeues haue them, who ſhall come to be arraigned and condemned for them. Their outward eſtate ſeemeth happy, but it is moſt ſlippery and vncertaine: when they ſay, peace, peace, then commeth ſudden deſtruction, as the paine vpon a Woman in trauaile.

It is ſaid, all things were made by the Sonne, <note n="g" place="margin">Iohn 1, 3.</note> and that without him, nothing was made that was made; the Spirit alſo did ſuſtaine and vphold that confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lumpe, which was the matter of the vniuerſall: ſo that they are ſaid and ſet downe to be Creators as well as the Father. In the worke of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Father willeth it, and electeth vs; the Sonne meriteth and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it, the Holy Ghoſt applyeth and appropriateth it.

Firſt, we ſee, that it is neceſſary for all that would pray aright, and would obtaine that which they deſire, to be well inſtructed in the Vnity of the Godhead, and the Trinity of the perſons, and to know the diſtinct properties of the perſons, without the vnderſtanding whereof, wee worſhip not the true God, but an Idoll. Our Sauiour in his conference with the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> chargeth the <note n="i" place="margin">Iohn 4, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Samaritans</hi> to worſhip they know not what: ſo doe many in our dayes, both Heretiques and ignorant perſons, they call vppon God confuſedlie, but they haue no particular knowledge of God at all. We muſt conceiue no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe of God in our minde, then he hath expreſſed in his word. The ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth to knowledge, to beleeue, to worſhip one God, and him one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If we conceiue or imagine, or receiue a multiplicity of Gods, wee turne the truth of God into a lie, and we erect vnto our ſelues ſo many Idols. Againe, the ſame Scripture ſetteth before vs three perſons in that Godhead; the Father, which is the firſt perſon in the Trinity of himſelfe; the Son, which is the ſecond perſon, begotten of the Father; the holy Ghoſt, which is the third perſon, proceeding from the Father and the Sonne. The Father is God, the Sonne is God, the holy Ghoſt is God, and yet theſe three perſons are not three Gods, but one onely God. And heere we haue in this place a notable Teſtimony of the God-head of the Sonne, where the Apoſtle deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and prayeth for grace and peace to be giuen to <hi>Philemon</hi> and his Wife, to <hi>Archippus</hi> and the Church, not onely from God the Father, but from the Lord Ieſus Chriſt. This had bin monſtrous &amp; horrible Idolatry and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.

This duty being required, it ſerueth to meete with many corruptions that are too common in the world. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinceth ſuch Heathniſh minded men as are of dead harts, and haue no ſpark of the life of Gods Spirite in them, that receiue and ſwallow vp daily diuers bleſſinges, yet neuer looke to GOD that bleſſeth them, but wee are like vnto the Swine that goe groueling to the ground, like the Horſe and Mule that haue no vnderſtanding at all, and ſo vſe all the profites and pleaſures of this life, without any acknowledgement and conſideration from whence they come, and of whom they haue receiued them: <note n="l" place="margin">Ezek. 32, 6.</note> or like vnto the

In him they liue and mooue, and haue their being, yet neuer acknowledge him, from whom they receiue life, and breath, and being. This is an euident argument of a prophane Spirit, <note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 14 4</note> and made the marke of an Atheiſt, not to pray to God.

They ſware by their names, when they entred into their Temples, they ſprinkled themſelues with holy Water, and they carried about with them their Images to worſhip.

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The ſecond queſtion an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> The ſecond queſtion ariſeth from hence, that <hi>Paule</hi> ſeemeth to make Faith reſpect the Saints, &amp; ſo to teach vs to beleeue in them, and to pray vnto them. For in the fift verſe he ſaith, he heard of <hi>Philemons</hi> loue and Faith which hee had toward the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and toward the Saints. But if the Apoſtle had meant to teach Faith to men, and to direct vs to beleeue in Saints, hee ſhould be contrary to the Doctrine deliuered by himſelfe, contrary to the reſt of the holy Scriptures, and contrary to the Articles of our Faith. Contrarie to himſelfe, becauſe he teacheth, <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 10, 13, 14.</note> that we cannot call vpon any, whom we do not know out of Gods word, and beleeue to be both able and willing to help vs, ſaying: <hi>Whoſoeuer ſhall call on the Name of the Lord, ſhall be ſaued: how then ſhall they call on him, on whom they haue not beleeued?</hi> Where he reaſoneth thus, that we muſt beleeue onely in God, and therefore pray onely to God.

For after that he had commended <hi>Philemon,</hi> for two chiefe guifts of God, Faith and Loue, in both which, conſiſt the perfection of a Chriſtian man, he aſſigneth to eyther of them their propper ſubiect; namely, that Faith is in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and Charity is toward all the Saints, which diſtinction and diuerſe Relation, may appeare by the Latine Interpretour, and by their owne <hi>Rhemiſh</hi> Tranſlation, altering the prepoſition, and reading it thus; <note n="n" place="margin">

                  <hi>Loue and Faith in Ieſus Chriſt, and toward all the Saints.</hi> Thirdly, the Apoſtle elſe-where hauing occaſion to mention theſe two graces of God, he doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them diſtinctly by their ſeuerall obiectes, and expreſly referreth Faith to Chriſt, and loue to the Saints, <note n="o" place="margin">Ephe. 1, 15.

Laſtly, Faith in the Saints cannot bee prooued, and inuocation of them eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed and grounded from hence, becauſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the Saints liuing, not departed; in the Church Militant, not Triumphant: the Saints on Earth, not in Heauen. For the Saints on Earth want our help, and craue our releefe to be extended toward them: but they that are in glory and haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued their Crowne, doe not ſtand in neede of our comfort and refreſhing: and therefore this is a weake foundation to builde the Popiſh Faith and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, in Saints that are dead and departed out of this life, ſeeing the Apoſtle vnderſtandeth it of one ſort, and they take it and ſtretch it to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The third que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion anſwered</note> The third queſtion is this, why the Apoſtle reſtraineth <hi>Philemons</hi> loue to the Saints, whereas loue is a common debt that we owe to all men, as the Apoſtle ſaith; <note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 13, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Owe nothing to any Man, but to loue one another, for hee that loueth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hath fulfilled the Law.</hi> Seeing therefore, loue ſhould not be reſtrained to the Saints, as though we ought to ſhut vp our bowels of pitty and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from others, and ſeeing we are not to deſpiſe our owne fleſh, but honour the Image of God engrauen in our Nature: how is it, that his loue which ought to comprehend all mankind, and enlarge it ſelfe to all others, is onelie mentioned to haue beene toward the diſtreſſed Saints and Members of the Church? The reaſon is, they which are of the Houſhold of Faith, are tyed to vs by a ſtronger and ſtraighter band of friendſhip and familiarity, and God commendeth them vnto vs more particularlie, and ſo they ought to challenge the firſt place, in declaring the fruits of our loue. The Apoſtle doth direct vs to this point, when he ſaith; <note n="ſ" place="margin">Gal. 6, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>While we haue time, let vs doe good vnto al men, but eſpecially to them which are of the Houſhold of Faith.</hi> We are charged to loue all, but we muſt loue the Saints with a peculiar and ſpeciall loue, euen as heires with Chriſt, and Members of the ſame body with vs. God requireth of vs to loue al men as his Creatures, but the godly as his Children. Though therefore our loue ſhould be common, and extend it ſelfe farre and neere into all the world: yet there ſhould bee certaine degrees, and an order in our loue ſhould be obſerued. We are commaunded to loue all, but we are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to loue all alike. We are bound to loue the godly and vngodlie, but we are not bound to loue the vngodly as the godly; the Reprobates as the elect; the Veſſels of wrath, as the Veſſels of honour; the Children of <hi>Belial,</hi> as the Children of God. We are therefore heere directed, whom we are moſt neerely and deerly to loue, euen thoſe that haue Chriſt dwelling in their harts, and grace ſhining in their faces. Contrary to the practiſe of worldly Men, who onely loue ſuch as are of this World; their loue is like themſelues, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane men, a prophane loue: carnall men, a carnall loue: they loue euill men for their euill, becauſe they partake with them in euill: they hate the godly for their godlineſſe, becauſe they are vnlike them, and will not runne with them into all exceſſe of ryot, <note n="t" place="margin">Pſal, 38, 20.</note> according to that which the Prophet hath, <hi>They that reward euill for good are mine enemies, becauſe I follow goodneſſe.</hi> This agreeth with that which Chriſt told and taught his Diſciples, <note n="u" place="margin">Iohn 15, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>If ye were of the world, the world would loue his owne: but becauſe ye are not of the World, but I haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen you out of the World, therefore the World hateth you.</hi> Thus much touching the deciding of the doubts and anſwering of the queſtions, that ariſe out of theſe

                  <hi>In all thinges giue thankes, for this is the will of God in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> Wee are ready to forget ſuch mercies as we haue receiued, and thereby make our ſelues vnworthy of further fauour. Secondly, conſider to whom he giueth thankes, to God: not to any Saint or Angell, or any Creatu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, to guide vs in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this duty. Thirdly, marke the perſon, for whom, for <hi>Philemon:</hi> ſo that wee are not onely bound to giue thankes for our ſelues, but for other, eſpecially when we ſee Gods word to bring forth fruit in the hearts of Men. Thus doth <hi>Paule</hi> in this place, reioyce for the godlineſſe of <hi>Philemon,</hi> and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where in his Epiſtles ſheweth himſelfe exceeding glad for the conuerſion of Nations and people to the Faith. Thus the Church of the Iewes <note n="y" place="margin">Gal. 1, 23.</note> are ſaid to glorifie God, when they heard of <hi>Paules</hi> conuerſion. This is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of all Chriſtians, ſpecially of the Miniſters, to pray continually for the Flock committed vnto them, and to praiſe the name of God for their increaſe in godlineſſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, obſerue that firſt he mentioneth his thankſ-giuing; then his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for him, ſo that he ioyneth the one with the other. Whereby we ſee, that prayers conceiued for our ſelues or others, are not to bee ſeuered from giuing of thankes. For no man is ſo perfect in this life, but be hath neede of dailie encreaſe in grace: and therefore we muſt ſo giue thankes for our Bretheren to God, in regard of the graces of his ſpirit which they haue receiued, that wee alſo pray inceſſantly for their growth in thoſe graces. Beſides, no man ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſo firmely rooted and grounded in grace, but hee may fall, and by his fall haue his guifts leſſened and diminiſhed, vnleſſe he be ſtrengthened and ſtayed vp by the meanes and helpes that God hath appointed: among the which are Prayers, both our owne and others.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, hee ſaith his Faith and loue were heard off, and ſpread abroad farre and neere: ſo that wee ſee Gods graces beſtowed vpon vs, will not be hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and concealed. We are ſet as vpon a Theater to be ſeene, all mens eies are fixed vpon vs, all Mens mouths will bee opened to ſpeake of vs, <note n="z" place="margin">Rom. 1, 8. 1 Kin. 18, 13.</note> and all mens eares will liſten what they can heare of vs, euen then when they are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from vs. On the otherſide, what euill ſoeuer we commit, wee cannot conceale and couer, we haue many eies vpon vs we ſhall haue a thouſand eares to hearken, and ten thouſand mouths to prattle againſt vs, ſo that we muſt ſo walke as we ſaw many with vs, and many ſaw vs how we walke. Sixtly, wee ſee heere a notable difference betweene vnfained praiſe, and fained flattery. The Apoſtle without any faining and fawning, rehearſeth in this place the commendation of <hi>Philemon,</hi>

For as one wicked man maketh another, and he that is ſeduced, is an Inſtrument to ſeduce another: ſo hee that is truely conuerted, will not reſt in the quiet fruit and inward comfort of his owne conuerſion, but labour to conuert others, and ſo make them partakers of that comfort which they haue found. The Apoſtle writing to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> ſaith of them; <note n="ſ" place="margin">1 Theſ 1, 6, 7</note>

The Apoſtle calleth the <hi>Phillippians</hi> his

                  <hi>For what is our hope, or ioy, or Crowne of reioycing? Are not euen you it, in the preſence of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt at his comming? Yes, ye are our glory and ioy.</hi> He doth not make the matter of his glorying, and the occaſion of his reioyſing to bee his calling, ſo much as the fruit of his calling: hee doth not comfort himſelfe ſo much in his Apoſtleſhip, as in the effect of his Apoſtleſhip; that is, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion and ſaluation of the <hi>Theſſalonians.</hi> If a man haue neuer ſo high and eminent a calling in the Church or Common-wealth, he cannot comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo much therein, as when he ſeeth the bleſſing of God vpon his labours, when he remembreth he hath kept a good conſcience therein, <note n="y" place="margin">2 Cor. 1, 15.</note> and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth he is to God the ſweete ſauour of Chriſt, in them that are ſaued, and in them that periſh.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 4.</note> Laſtly, the graces of God, and the growing in theſe graces, are fruites of their election, and ſeales of their ſaluation, ſo that the Angels in Heauen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce at the conuerſion of a Sinner. Euery grace of GOD addeth aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: the greater graces, the greater aſſurance: the more graces, the more aſſurance: the growth of graces, is the growing of our aſſuraunce.

For his ioy in their growth, and his comfort in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, will cauſe him aboue all things to labour after it. There is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the Miniſter like to this comfort, when he ſeeth the fruits of godlines, as it were the markes of Gods Spirit to ſhine forth brightly in his people. What comfort hath the Husbandman, more in his husbandry, then to ſee the fruits of the earth; not to be blaſted, but to be bleſſed; not to wither, but to grow; what ioy hath the Shepheard like to this, when he ſeeth the flocke not to be infected, but to flouriſh: not to be rotten and ſcabbed, but to be ſound
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7222:47"/> and whole: not to decreaſe and decay, but to encreaſe and to bring forth thouſands and ten thouſands in our ſtreetes. What greater delight hath the Nurſe, then to ſee her child liue in health, grow vp in ſtrength and ſtature and proſper in the world? So there is no comfort like to this comfort, no ioy like to this ioy, no delight like to this delight, to behold the harueſt of the Lord, the ſheepe of Chriſt, the Children of God, to flouriſh and to encreaſe more and more to grow from faith to faith, &amp; from grace to grace, <note n="b" place="margin">Ephe. 4. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>vntill they all meet together vnto a perfect man; and vnto the meaſure of the age of the fulnes of Chriſt.</hi> Hence it is, that after the Apoſtle had teſtified his ioy and thankes to God for the faith and loue of the Coloſſians he addeth: <note n="c" place="margin">Col. 19. 10.</note>

We liue in a decaying and declining time, wherein many haue forgotten their firſt loue: we ſee the cold ſeaſon and Winter of all Godlines, wherein men are frozen in the dregs of Sinne. Wee may behold with our eyes (if we be not ſtarke blinde) a generall waſting, languiſhing, and conſumption of the heate and heart of Religion. If then in this common pining of the vital parts, we may diſcerne any reuiuing and refreſhing to appeare, or any flouriſhing of Godlines (which ſeemed dead at the root) to ſpring vp, let it be a comfort vnto vs, and teach vs to giue God the glory, who maketh light to come out of darkeneſſe, and life to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe out of death. This ſerueth to reproue thoſe that neuer deſire the profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their people, nor regard what their eſtate, and how their ſtanding is in heauenly thinges: they neuer conſider whether they goe forward or back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: whether they grow vpward or downe-ward, to Heauen or to Hell, to God or to the Deuill, to Saluation or to damnation. Theſe are they that feed themſelues to the full, but regard not to feed the flocke ouer which the holy Ghoſt hath made them ouerſeers. Theſe are they that liue of the Alter, but care not to miniſter at the Alter: they will be ſure to reape carnall things but they haue no conſcience to ſow ſpirituall thinges. They liue of the Goſpell, but they will not preach the Goſpell. The Apoſtle teſtifying his longing and thirſting after the ſaluation of the Church, ſaid, <hi>I ſeeke not yours but you.</hi> But theſe men, if they would ſpeake the truth from their hearts, might ſay: we ſeeke not you, but yours, we care not what become of you, ſo that we may find the ſweetnes of that which is yours. How farre are theſe from the zealous affection of the ſame Apoſtle, who became all thinges to all men if by any meanes he might ſaue ſome: he teacheth that a neceſſity lay vpon him to preach the Goſpell, and denounceth a woe vpon himſelfe if he preach not the Goſpell. Let vs all in our places follow his example, and pray vnto God to giue the grace of conuerſion to turne the hearts of men to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing knowledge of the Goſpell: and where he hath granted this mercy let vs pray him to encreaſe it more and more, and to continue it vnto the day of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>

This is a great griefe of heart and goeth neere them, to ſee ſo little growth of Godlines, ſo little fruit of their labours, ſo great encreaſe of all vngodlines. This reproueth thoſe that make a mocke of ſinne, and can laugh as heartilie at the committing of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, as at the beſt ieaſt and the greateſt ſport. If we begin once to laugh at ſinne, we will not make any conſcience to commit it. When once we do not ſticke to ieaſt at it, we will quickly come to it in good earneſt. When we can make a play of it, there is but a ſhort ſtep to put it in practiſe. The very Heathen <note n="i" place="margin">

But how many are there among vs that would be counted and are indeed called Chriſtians, who come farre behind the blinde Infidels, who are open ieaſters at euill, and deriders of good. This laughing is the beginning of euill, when ieaſtes turne to good earneſt, and wordes into deeds. Theſe men are farre from the practiſe of thoſe whom we heard before commended out of the word of God, and from the Godly affection of Dauid and Ieremy, of Paule and Chriſt himſelfe, who mourned in ſoule to behold the ſinnes that raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and were commonly practiſed in their daies. This is a notable ſigne and aſſurance to our owne hearts that we hate them indeede when they do draw out of vs buckets of water and riuers of teares. This griefe of heart was in the Apoſtle writing to the Phillippians, when he ſaw the looſe behauiour of of many that profeſſed Chriſt in word, but denied him in deed, of whom he ſaith, <note n="l" place="margin">Phil. 3. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Many walke, of whom I haue told you often, and now tell you weeping, that they are the enemies of the Croſſe of Chriſt, whoſe end is damnation, whoſe God is their belly, whoſe glory is to their ſhame, which mind earthly thinges.</hi> Now it cannot be but the hearts of the faithfull Miniſters and godly bretheren, will be greatly grieued and vexed, when they ſee God diſhonoured by our care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe walking, and ſtanding ſtill idle all the day long withou a labouring in his Vineyard: We muſt daily increaſe and grow ſtrong in faith, or elſe we decreaſe and grow weake in ſaith. If we wax not euery day better, we fall to be worſe and worſe. We neuer ſtand at one ſtay. If we walke not forward, we runne backeward, like the water of the Sea, that if it do not flow, it ebbeth: or like vnto the life of man, if ſtrength encreaſeth not, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth.

So long as we encreaſe and proceede vnto a perfect man, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the meaſure of the age of the fulneſſe of Chriſt, that we bee hence-forth no more Children, wauering and carried about with euery winde of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, by the deceit of men, and with craftineſſe, whereby they lay in waite to deceiue, we make Chriſt glad, we reioyce the Spirit of God, wee make glad the Angels, we comfort and cheere vp the hearts of the godly, and we bring that peace to our owne hearts, which paſſeth all vnderſtanding. On the other ſide, if we grow backward, and decline by little and little from the holy profeſſion of the truth, which we haue receiued, we crucifie Chriſt, wee quench the Spirit, we greeue the Angels, wee offend the faithfull, and wee wound our owne Soules. This dutie vrged from this Doctrine, reprooueth ſundry ſorts of people, that doe not deſire to delight the hearts of thoſe that haue inſtructed them, and to comfort them that haue laboured in the word and Doctrine among them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſuch as haue continued long in the Church, and grow in yeares, but not in knowledge. What comfort can theſe men bring to their Teachers and Inſtructers, when no increaſe is ſeene, or can be marked in them? It is a common, but a moſt fearefull ſinne, not to profit and proceede in the waies of godlineſſe: and yet it is to bee feared, that not one of an hundred com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth with any deſire of inſtruction, with any care of ſanctification, with any purpoſe of reformation, with any hunger after ſaluation. If men goe to the the Market to buy their prouiſion, and to ſupply the neceſſities of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, we ſee what they bring home, we ſee they returne not empty, we ſee they come backe laden. But when they goe to the Houſe of God, and frequent the exerciſes of his word, how often doe they returne with empty handes; nay, with empty hearts, nay, with hard hearts, and ſo worſe then they came vnto them? This is it which the Apoſtle <note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 6, 7, 8.</note> teacheth. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. <hi>The earth which drinketh in the Raine that commeth oft vpon it, and bringeth forth Hearbs meete for them by whom it is dreſſed, receiueth bleſſing of God: but that which beareth Thornes and Bryars, is reprooued, and is neere vnto curſſing, whoſe ende is to bee burned.</hi> Secondly, heereby is condemned the want of the fruits of kindneſſe toward the Paſtors, whereby they may bee encouraged, and made cheerefull and comfortable in their calling. Some there are, whom we may well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the better, or (at leaſt) none of the worſer ſort, who abſtaine from hurting, wronging, and moleſting their Miniſters, but they withall, abſtaine from ſhewing ſuccour, helpe, or countenance toward them: they will indeed doe them no euill, but likewiſe they will doe them no good, contemning them in their heart: they will not be open enemies, profeſſing hatred toward them, but withall, they are not their friendes to giue them any comfort, they vſe them ſtrangely and vnciuilly, as baſe abiects in their ſight, when as their calling is as much honored and magnified in the word, by the mouth of God, as any calling vnder Heauen.</p>
               <p>This was the ſin of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for a time, who wanted loue &amp; kindneſſe in ſupporting the Apoſtle vnder the waight of his calling, ſo that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7222:49"/> to ſtand vpon the commending of himſelfe, and the extolling of his Miniſtry, <note n="o" place="margin">2 Cor. 12, 11</note> 
                  <hi>I was a foole to boaſt my ſelfe, yee haue compelled mee: for I ought to haue beene commended of you, for in nothing was I inferiour vnto the very chiefe Apoſtles, though I be nothing.</hi> This alſo the ſame Apoſtle complaineth of in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place, <note n="p" place="margin">2 Tim. 4, 16</note> 
                  <hi>At my first anſwearing, no man aſſisted me, but all forſooke mee, I pray God that it may not be layde vnto their charge.</hi>

               <p>Theſe men did not diſpraiſe him, but they would not commend him: They would not renounce him, yet they would not defend him: as they wold not diſclaime him, ſo likewiſe they would not aſsiſt him. Of this ſort are manie that liue among vs, who thinke they haue diſcharged a worthy duty toward the Miniſter, if they do him no harme, if they offer him no wrong, if they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from iniurie toward him. It was farre otherwiſe with the <hi>Galathians,</hi> who loued <hi>Paule</hi> ſo dearly and entirely, that they accounted nothing to bee too precious for him, <note n="q" place="margin">Gal. 4, 14, 15</note> 
                  <hi>The triall of me which was in my fleſh, ye deſpiſed not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abhorred; but ye receiued me as an Angell of God, yea as Chriſt Ieſus: what was then your felicity? For I beare you record, that if it had beene poſſible, ye would haue plucked out your owne eyes, and haue giuen them vnto me.</hi> But in theſe daies wherein we liue, it were well, or not much amiſſe for the faithfull Miniſters of the Goſpell, if ſuch as ſhould ſupport them, would not ſubuert them; if ſuch as ſhould help them, would not hinder them; if ſuch as ſhould raiſe them vp, were not ready to caſt them downe; and if ſuch as ſhould refreſh them, were not rather giuen to reuile them, and diſgrace them. Heere then is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all hard and bitter dealing toward them (whereby their calling which is an honourable office, is made an irkſome burthen vnto them to bear) againſt ſuch as taunt and ſcorne them, that ieſt and mocke at the worke of their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, which is the wiſedome of God, and the power of God, againſt thoſe that delight to vex the ſeruants of God, to mingle their bread with grauell, their drinke with gall, and their life with reproach. This made the Prophets and Apoſtles cry out continually, to ſee themſelues abuſed, their Miniſtery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, the word of God himſelfe refuſed, &amp; all Religion prophaned.

Hence it is, that oftentimes the Husband checketh the Wife; the Father controuleth the Sonne; and one Friend tebuketh another, as running too faſt, and ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting beyond the marke. Howſoeuer this is not greatly to bee feared in our daies, wherein few runne at all, &amp; many ſtand ſtill, wherein fewe ſhoot at the marke; yet if it were ſo, it is better to be a little too forward, then to bee too backward; to haue a little too much zeale, then to be ſtark cold, as many; or luke-warme as the moſt are. We ſee this in the ſtate of a mans bodie, it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier to worke an euacuation of that which is too much, then to procure a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of that which is too little.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7222:50"/> It is eaſier to pull downe a part of the building which is ouer-much, then to lay a new foundation. If there be one among vs that ſeeketh to be too iuſt, and aymeth at a righteouſnes aboue the Law, there are a thouſand that come too ſhort, and fayle in that which is required of them. It is a moſt bleſſed thing to keepe the Golden meane betweene too much and too little. It is eaſier to bring him that is in the exceſſe to the meane, then to reduce him to the meane, that is in the defect. When a man lyeth dead in ſinnes and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, and hath no ſparke of the life of God in him, to bring ſuch an one to true godlineſſe, is, as it were, to raiſe him from the dead. When a man lieth languiſhing and conſuming by little and little, and all good things begin to decay in him, ſo that he is growne ſtarke cold; nothing is harder then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore ſuch a one; it is as much as to worke a wonder and miracle. But when our zeale is growne to be a little too hot, and our edge made ſomewhat too ſharpe, it requireth no great labour, it asketh no great paines to reduce vs backe againe, and to make vs returne home the way by which we went. There is no cauſe therefore, that wee ſhould ſo raſhly and out-ragiouſly beare our ſelues toward thoſe that climbe vp a ſtep too high, and beare them-ſelues a little too forward: let vs rather examine our ſelues, and conſider whether we do not our ſelues many wayes faile of our duties; ſo that wee may ſay, and ſay truely, we are vnprofitable ſeruants. Let vs neuer enuy or grudge at the good of others, remembering alwayes, that what grace ſoeuer is graunted to one member, is giuen to the whole bodie, and to euerie particular member of the body; As he that doth good to the eye, doth good to the whole body, &amp; the benefite redowndeth to the hand and foot.

Hence it is, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Colliars Faith, <note n="k" place="margin">

This fable hath beene ſo long told and related among them, that now themſelues begin to beleeue it to be a truth; as a lyar by often telling an vntruth, beginneth to thinke it may be a true tale. This Colliars faith is the popiſh Creed, which being founded in ignorance, is too weake a ſhield to quench the fiery Darts of the Deuill, and to reſiſt his tentations. Thus true faith is ſuppreſſed, &amp; ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance is ſet on foote by theſe ignoraunt Teachers, who as they are blinde themſelues, ſo they would put out the eyes of others.

This ignorance is plentifully condemned in the Scriptures. We are taught, <note n="m" place="margin">Col. 3. 16. 1 Pet. 3, 15.</note> that the word muſt dwell plentifully in vs, and that we muſt be able to giue an account of the hope that is in vs, to them that ſhall require an aunſwere of vs. We are taught <note n="n" place="margin">Math. 22, 29 Rom. 15, 4 Hebr. 5, 11. Iohn 5, 39.</note> that ignorance is the Mother of all euill, the roote of all error, the cauſe of all vnbeleefe, and that whatſoeuer things are written afore hand, were written for our learning, that wee might haue comfort and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.</p>
               <p>Thus do theſe enemies of God and his people, take from them their ſword when they ſhould go to fight, and ſtrip them of their Armor when they ſhould enter the battell; like Theeues, that put out the Candle which ſerueth to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer them. To conclude, let vs know that an ignorant faith is no faith, for where there is no knowledge, there can bee no faith. But ſuch as liue in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> being blindly led of blinde Teachers, doo know nothing to their comfort, they haue the key of Knowledge taken from them, they are nuzled and encouraged in ignoraunce, they heare it magnified and extolled vnto the skies. Some of them pretend the reading of the Scriptures in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tongue, and in the tranſlation that all may vnderſtand, to bee a principall cauſe of hereſie. Another ſhameth not to auouch, that it was the inuention of the Deuill, to permit the people to read the Bible. Another bluſheth not to write, that he knew certaine men poſſeſſed of a Deuill, becauſe being but Husbandmen, they were able to diſcourſe of the Scriptures. They teach, that it is Hereſy for a Lay-man to diſpute in a point of faith. Theſe men ſpeake not by the ſpirit of God, but vtter the Deuils language, and inſtruct the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Colliars Creed. It is written of <hi>Timothy,</hi>

And howſoeuer ſome may thinke it to bee a very groſſe and homely compariſon, to compare men to the Deuils, yet if wee examine the faith and practiſe of wicked and carnall men, we ſhall eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, not onely that the Deuils are equall vnto them, but doo go manie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees before them. For firſt, the Deuils vnderſtand the Law and the Goſpell: They know the end of the one, and the vſe of the other: They giue aſſent to the Couenant of Grace that it is true, they know that it is certaine &amp; ſure, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7222:51"/> that God will giue remiſsion of ſinnes, and the glory of immortality to the members of his Church. They know the Perſon, the Natures, the Offices of Chriſt. They know that all things ſpoken in the Scripture ſhall be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. This appeareth in the confeſſion which they make in many places of the Goſpell concerning Chriſt, <note n="r" place="margin">Marke 1, 24. &amp; 3. 11 Luke 4, 41.</note> 
                  <hi>I know thee what thou art, euen that holie one of God; thou art the ſonne of God, thou art that Chriſt.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Iames,</hi> ſpeaking of ſuch as gloried in a falſe faith, but wanteth the true Faith, ſayeth; <hi>Thou beleeueſt that there is one God, thou dooeſt well:</hi> 
                  <note n="ſ" place="margin">Iames 2, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>the Deuils alſo beleeue it, and tremble.</hi> He ſetteth downe a chiefe point of Religion which the Deuils beleeue, concerning the vnity of the God-head; and this faith of the Deuil, is not to be reſtrained to this one principall point, but it ſtretcheth to the whole Doctrine of faith: ſo that he ſetteth down expreſſely this one ground &amp; foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, inſtead of the whole body of Chriſtianity. For the Deuils do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeue that there is one God, who hath created all things, and gouerneth all things, and ſhall iudge all the world; but that there is one Chriſt, one Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, one Redeemer. And this is a ſure reaſon that they knowe this great Myſtery of godlineſſe, God manifeſt in the fleſh, becauſe they ſeeke to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, deſtroy, and deface it by contrary errors. But how manie are there among the ſonnes of men, that take themſelues to bee great Chriſtians, and thinke they are better then the Deuils that know not theſe things? Are there not many that are among vs, and liue in the boſom of the Church, who would defie them that ſhould charge them to come behinde the Deuils, &amp; yet know not the Doctrine of the Trinity, the perſon of Chriſt, the vnion of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the end of the Lawe, the Sacraments of the Church, the Couenant of the Goſpell, the Nature of Faith, the Iuſtification of a Sinner, and the way of ſaluation?</p>
               <p>Againe, the Apoſtle teacheth, not only that the Deuils beleeue the things that are written in the ſcripture, but likewiſe that they tremble at the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God contained in the ſcripture. They knowe the promiſe of the Goſpell, they heare of remiſsion of ſinnes, they beleeue there is in eternal life which the bleſſed of the Father ſhall inherite, but they feele no ioy in it, they receyue no comfort by it, they are neuer a whit delighted with it, becauſe they know themſelues ſeparated from it, and to be reſerued for the wrath to com; as we finde it vttered of the Deuils through the mouth of the poſſeſſed, <note n="t" place="margin">Math. 8, 29.</note>

                  </gap>y are not perſwaded, nor cannot beleeue, that they pertaine any thing at all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: They haue no hope of mercy, they haue no aſſurance of pardon, they haue no expectation of ſaluation. Now, as they beleeue that the promiſes of God do not concern them, ſo they know that the threatnings of God ſhal certainly come vpon them, and that eternal torments are prepared for them, which is the cauſe of their feare and trembling. But how many wicked men are there that liue in ſenſuality, and are drowned in ſecurity. They are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to lye ſtill in ſin, and yet conſider not what hangeth ouer their heads. Tell the Deuils of their eſtate wherein they ſtand, and they tremble; Tell the vngodly of their condition, they are careleſſe. The Deuils in remembraunce of Iudgements, deſpayre; the vngodly preſume. The Deuils are conſtrained to confeſſe that God is iuſt, the vngodly waſh it away and ſay; tuſh God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull. Thus doth Satan beſot and bewitch the Reprobate, &amp; teacheth them a leſſon which he could neuer learn himſelfe; namely, that Gods word is not all true, and that the threatnings there pronounced, ſhall not fall vpon them, and therefore we ſee, ſuch as are taught and reprooued by the Miniſtry of the word, either to be as ſenceleſſe blockes not mooued at all with them, or as
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7222:52"/> open blaſphemers, reuiling and railing at the word. Theſe are notable and forward Schollers, and haue profited deeply in the Deuils Schoole, they are growne to bee more cunning then their Maiſter, and haue out-gone him in their profeſſion, and therefore they muſt be as neere condemnation as he. This faith then to beleeue that part of Gods worde, which conſiſteth in beleeuing Gods vengeance and threatnings is hardly to be found among the vngodly, and therefore the faith of the Deuils is more perfect; which ſhould teach vs to labour that our faith may exceed and go beyond the Deuils, and that wee may ſeeke to apply the mercifull promiſes of God to our ſelues, and ſo to find comfort in them, which the Deuils want. We muſt not only ſay, Chriſt gaue himſelfe, but he gaue himſelfe for me; It is not enough to ſay he loueth man, but he loueth me; he is a Sauiour, but hee is my Sauiour; hee is a Redeemer, but he is my Redeemer; he forgiueth ſinnes, but hee forgiueth me my ſinnes. It is not enough to ſay, he ſaued others; but we muſt ſay, he ſaueth me: hee is not onely the God of others, but he is my God, and my Lord. This was the comfort that <hi>Dauid</hi> felt, when hee ſaith; <note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 18, 2.</note>

This is not to offer iniurie to other men, or to make him peculiar to our ſelues, but to leaue him the ſame to others, that hee is to vs, as euery man enioyeth the light of the Sunne, without excluding others from the vſe thereof.</p>

If we beleeue not this, we beleeue nothing; if we deny this, or doubt of this, all our Faith is in vaine.

For firſt, the Communion and fellowſhip that is among the Saints, requireth our Prayers one for another.

So that the want of it, is a plaine argument, that we are not members of the ſame body, ſeeing we deſire not the good of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 2.</note> Secondly, it is a moſt forcible weapon put into our hands, whereby we are made able to helpe our ſelues, and the reſt of our Brethren which are fellow-ſouldiers with vs, all of vs fighting vnder the ſame Captain, Ieſus Chriſt. Their fighting is our fighting; their retyring is our retyring; their victory is our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; their looſing of the field, is our looſing of the field. For euerie one is not a Soldier by himſelfe, but wee are all ioynt-ſouldiers together, wee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come together, and we are put to the foyle together. For euen as ſouldiers
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7222:53"/> do not onely ſtand vpon their ſeuerall guards, but vnite their forces togither, whereby it commeth to paſſe, that they who being ſeuered aſſunder, and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered abroad, might eaſily be ouercome, hauing ioyned their forces, are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable and vnreſiſtable: ſo if we doo not onely looke to our ſelues, and our owne footing, but ioyne in Prayer with other, they for vs, and wee for them, our ſpirituall enemies ſhall not be able to confront vs, or confound vs, but we ſhall make them turne their backes to vs, and their faces from vs. The Apoſtle <note n="g" place="margin">Epheſ. 6, 18.</note> naming the Armour which we muſt all put on to defend our ſelues and our Brethren, and to offend our enemy, doth ſet down Prayer as a chiefe meanes to obtaine Gods aſſiſtance for our ſelues and others.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 3.</note> Thirdly, Prayer is a Medicine to heale all maladies, and a Plaiſter to cure all ſores.

So then, it muſt needs be a ſoueraigne Salue that ſerueth to ſuch ſeuerall purpoſes. This is it which the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> pointeth out vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, <note n="h" place="margin">Iames 5, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Acknowledge your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that yee may be healed: for the Prayer of a righteous man auayleth much, if it bee feruent.</hi> Seeing therefore wee are as a body ſtanding of many members, and ſeeing prayer is a weapon to defend vs, and a medicine to heale vs: it followeth, that we muſt vſe it, one to helpe and ſuccour another.</p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</note> Now let vs ſee what are the Vſes. Firſt, we learne, that the vſe of prayer, both publicke and priuate, for our ſelues and others, is moſt neceſſary. It is a ſpeciall gift of the ſpirit, which is common to all, for all haue not the grace of Prayer. The Apoſtle ſaith, <note n="i" place="margin">1 Tim 2, 1.</note> 
                  <hi>I exhort that first of all, ſupplications, prayers, interceſſions, and giuing of thankes be made for all men.</hi> The neglect of this is a note of a ranke Atheiſt, <note n="k" place="margin">Pſalme 53, 4.</note> who is deſcribed not to call vpon God. Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus did oftentimes pray, he was feruent and continuall in it; hee ſpent whole nights in Prayer. When he was in his Agony, he prayed once, and againe, and the third time. This condemneth thoſe that are careleſſe and negligent in the practiſe of this dutie, that are ſo couetous for themſelues, that they can craue nothing for their Brethren. If one member of the body ſhould ſcrape all to it ſelfe, what would become of the reſt? Such are vnnaturall members, as take care onely for themſelues. Theſe can ſay the Lords Prayer, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe the wordes, but their hearts are farre from the meaning and right vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. They ſay, Lord giue vs our daily Bread, that is, to me, and to my brethren; not to me alone; nor to them alone, but to me, and to them; to theſe my Brethren, as well as to my ſelfe. Theſe men are liberall in words, bur couetous in mind; their mouths are opened and enlarged, but their harts are reſtrained and inſtraightned; they thinke they neuer haue enough, and that their Brethren haue too much. They are farre from giuing thankes vnto God for them, who repine at euerie morſell that they eate, and at euery bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that they enioy.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 2.</note> Secondly, we learne that the weakeſt and meaneſt in the Church are not to be deſpiſed and contemned, inaſmuch as they may by their prayers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes helpe the ſtrongeſt and the greateſt. The Apoſtle teacheth, that God hath ſo framed the members of the body, <note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 12, 21, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>That the eye cannot ſay vnto the hand, I haue no need of thee; nor the head againe to the feete, I haue no neede of you; yea, much rather thoſe members of the body, which ſeeme to be feeble, are neceſſarie.</hi> The ſtrongeſt ſtand in need of the helpe of the weakeſt; the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, of the meaneſt; the higheſt, of the loweſt; the richeſt, of the pooreſt; the Prince, of the people. All mankind are ſo created, as that they are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of themſelues, but euery one wanteth the ayde of another. One Nation ſtandeth in need of another, no Countrey yeeldeth all commodities. No man
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7222:54"/> hath all the gifts of Nature, but ſome one, ſome haue others. We ſee it euen among the brute beaſts, ſuch as are excellent in craft, and mighty in ſtrength, yet haue their wants together with their wiles, and their maimes ioyned with their great might. The Fox is ſubtle to keepe himſelfe from ſnares, yet hee is weake to guard himſelfe from Wolues: on the other ſide, the Lion is ſtrong enough to guard himſelfe from Wolues, but he is not ſubtle enough to keepe himſelfe from nets. We haue not all thinges requiſite and neceſſary for vs, we haue not all properties to be commended: wee runne into many dangers, from whence the meaneſt may helpe to deliuer the mightieſt. So then, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we are enioyned to pray one for another, and thereby may helpe one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, let vs know, that we muſt deſpiſe no man, reproch no man, hate no man, but conſider that at one time or other, we may want the help &amp; hand of him. This doth the Wiſe-man point vnto, <note n="m" place="margin">Eccl. 9, 14, 15.</note> when he mentioneth a little City, and few men in it, and a great King came againſt it, compaſſed it about, and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded forts againſt it: and there was found therein a poore and Wiſe-man, and he deliuered the Citty by his wiſedome. And wee haue a notable example heereof, in the ſiedge of <hi>Abell</hi> by <hi>Ioab,</hi> a wiſe woman cried out of the Cittie, and mooued him to returne from the aſſault. We ſee how forcible the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Abraham</hi> were to mooue the Lord to ſpare the <note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 18.</note> Sodomites, if tenne righteous perſons had beene found in the Citty. Thus God teſtifyeth, that he was reſtrained by the Prayers of Moſes, and (as it were) <note n="o" place="margin">Exod. 32, 10</note> tied with bands, that hee was not able to deſtroy the people. Let vs therefore make much one of another, and let no man hate his Brother in his heart, but know, that his prayers auaile with God for him. Wee ſee the Prayers of the Church profited <hi>Peter</hi> much, though he were an Apoſtle, <note n="p" place="margin">Acts 12.</note> for thereby he was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of priſon, and from the daunger of death, by the Miniſtry of an Angel. So they profit vs, if they be faithfull and ſeruent.</p>

The Apoſtle is oftentimes earneſt in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this at the Churches handes, <note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 15, 30</note> 
                  <hi>Brethren, I beſeech you for our Lorde Ieſus Chriſts ſake, and for the loue of the ſpirit, that ye would ſtriue with me by prayers to God for me.</hi> When we are poore, and can doe our Brethren no other good, yet may we benefit them by our Prayers. When we ſee our Brethren in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, in danger, in affliction, in perſecution, in ſickneſſe, and in great miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; when we haue no hand to help them, no power to deliuer them, no means to ſuccour them, no fauour to ſpeake for them; yet, wee haue hearts to lifte vp for them to God, the Father of all mercies, and the God of all conſolation, and by praying vnto him for them, we ſhall do them much good, giue them much comfort, miniſter vnto them much helpe, and procure vnto them ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy deliuerance. This ſhall bee more auaileable and profitable vnto them, then all other meanes of helpe and ſuccour, vſed for their ſafety without this. Let ſuch as are of the greateſt giftes earneſtly craue and call for the prayers of thoſe that haue leſſer and ſmaller gifts. This reproueth ſuch as neuer regard them, nor require them, that thinke they haue no neede of them, nor know the neceſſity of them. It is all one to theſe men, whether they bee prayed for, or not; whom God no doubt doth oftentimes croſſe in the works of their hands, that they do not proſper, becauſe they make no account of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Prayers. It reprooueth ſuch alſo, as regard not the publick aſſemblies of the faithfull, and the meeting of the Congregation of Chriſt in one place, where Prayers are made for the Church, where praiſes are ſung, and thankes are rendred for the bleſſings of God; yea, heauen and earth are made to ring and rebound with ſounding out his glorie, as it were with the voice of one man.

It is a great priuiledge belonging onely to the faithfull, to haue right and interreſt in the Churches Prayers. It is not ſo with the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo long as they abhorre ſuch meetings, which are the moſt fruitful ſeaſons, when God with a gracious dew doth raine vpon his inheritaunce, they are as barren trees, and as withered branches that are reſerued for the fire of Gods vengeance, and heauy indignation. This is it which the Prophet ſayeth, <note n="t" place="margin">Pſal. 129, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>They which go by ſhall not ſay, the bleſſing of the Lord be vpon you, or, We bleſſe you in the name of the Lord.</hi> So long therefore, as they remaine in this contempt of God, and of his Religion, the prayers of the Church ſhall not auayle them. <note place="margin" type="runSum">3.</note> Laſtly, it reproueth ſuch as neglect this duty, and whereas they ſhould pray for others, do curſe and ban them, and wiſh all euil to come vpon them.

We are commaunded <note n="x" place="margin">Math. 5, 44,</note> to loue in ſtead of hating, to do good inſtead of hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to pray inſtead of perſecuting, and to bleſſe inſteade of Curſſing.

                        <hi>Verſe</hi> 5.</bibl> [<hi>When I heare of thy loue and Faith which thou haſt towardes the Lord Ieſus, and toward all Saints.</hi>]</q> In theſe words, the former Thankeſ-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing is amplified by another circumſtaunce, containing the cauſe wherefore the Apoſtle gaue thankes to his God for him, and did make mention of him in his Prayers, becauſe he had heard by the report of the Brethren, howe great Faith and Loue were in him. Heerein we haue theſe particulars to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; Firſt, hee reduceth the principall pointes of ſaluation to two heads, Faith, and Loue. In theſe ſtandeth the happineſſe of the godly: by theſe, a Chriſtian man is perfected, for they are the chiefe graces of the Holy-ghoſt. Secondly, he beginneth with [<hi>Loue,</hi>] and placeth it before [<hi>Faith.</hi>] Faith, indeed is more precious, but it is inward and hidden in the heart, and in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and order goeth before Loue: but hee firſt nameth [<hi>Loue</hi>] becauſe it is better knowne to vs, better ſeene of vs, and is as the Touch-ſtone to try our Faith. For though the cauſe be more worthy then the effect, yet the effect is more perſpicuous and manifeſt: ſo Faith being the cauſe of works, is more excellent, but Loue as an effect is more euident. Thirdly, wee ſee, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit Faith be ſet in the laſt place, for the reaſon rendered before, yet Fayth is firſt defined, and ſo the order ſomewhat inuerted. Now, it is deſcribed and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7222:55"/> declared by his Obiect, that it reſpecteth Chriſt Ieſus. Laſt of all, hee defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth loue, which he aplieth to the Saints, albeit it extend to Infidels, to repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brates, to prophane enemies, whom alſo we are to loue, yet a ſpeciall maner of loue is due to the Saints, which are members of the ſame body with vs. For euen as God loueth all mankind, and all the workes of his hand, who as hee created them, ſo he preſerueth them, feedeth them, giueth them fruitfull ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, filleth their hearts with ioy and gladneſſe, and maketh his Sun to ſhine vpon them, and the raine to fall vppon them, to make them without excuſe: but he loueth his Church with a ſpeciall loue, not onely giuing them tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bleſſings, but ſuch as do accompany ſaluation; the one, hee loueth as his creatures; the other, both as his creatures, and his Children: ſo are wee to loue all mankind as our owne fleſh, but not in an equal degree with the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, who are tied together in a ſtraighter band, becauſe there is not mutuall loue betweene the godly and vngodly, neither do they grow vppe into one body.

We ſee this in <hi>Daniell,</hi> and the three Children, hee was caſt into the Lyons den, they into the hot fiery furnace, becauſe they thought it not ſufficient to worſhip God cloſely and ſecretly in their hearts, but publickly declared what God they ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and what religion they embraced.

Chriſt Ieſus will neuer beare and endure that ſeruant, which is aſhamed of his ſeruice.

                  <hi>One ſhall ſay, I am the Lords: another ſhall bee called by the name of Iacob: and another, ſhall ſubſcribe with his hand vnto the Lord, and name himſelfe by the name of Iſraell.</hi> This the Apoſtle <note n="m" place="margin">Ro. 10, 9, 10</note> alſo teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſſe with thy mouth the Lorde Ieſus, and ſhalt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in thine heart, that God raiſed him vp from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaued: for with the heart man beleeueth vnto righteouſneſſe, and with the mouth man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to ſaluation.</hi> So our Sauiour doth not make it proper to his diſciples, but common to all, to confeſſe him and his words before men. And he doth not ſay, whoſoeuer ſhall confeſſe mee in heart, but with his tongue; not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, but outwardly; not ſecretly, but openly. For albeit, the Faith of the heart be the principall thing, and cheefely required of vs; yet the confeſſion of the mouth muſt not bee ſeparated from it.

Euery one would ſeeme willing and deſirous to be ſaued, but if we looke to be partakers thereof, Chriſt muſt know vs for his ſeruants: and he will not acknowledge vs in his kingdome, vnleſſe heere we make confeſsion of him.

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 2</note> Secondly, ſeeing our Faith and Religion muſt be confeſſed, it is a duty that lieth vpon vs to ſeeke to know the truth, and labour to expreſſe the power of godlineſſe; otherwiſe it is vnpoſsible that euer we ſhould make profeſsion of it. For profeſsion of the faith preſuppoſeth a knowledge of the faith; for how can we confeſſe that which we kno not, or manifeſt that to other wherof we are ignorant our ſelues? This controlleth and condemneth thoſe that liue in the Church, heare the word, and haue the Goſpell ſounding a long time in their eares, yet know not what faith is, nor how to beleeue; ſo that whereas in regard of their continuance in the Church, in regard of the meanes offred to them, and in regard of their age wherewith God hath bleſſed them, <note n="r" place="margin">Heb. 5, 12.</note> they might haue been teachers of others, they haue neede to be taught the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of faith, the grounds of religion, &amp; the principles of the word of God, and are become ſuch as haue neede of milke, and not of ſtrong meate. Alas, who can conſider without great greefe of heart, and anguiſh of ſpirit, in what ſtate the greateſt number of our people ſtand, and remember that after al our planting, watering, ſowing, and labouring, they are apt and fit to receiue any religion, becauſe they are blinde and ignorant, and know not God aright, or any part of his truth, to their ſoules health. They are like the potters Clay, which is readie to take any forme, and receiue any impreſſion; or like the earth, which altereth and changeth as the winde or weather, as the Spring or Winter ſhall worke vpon it. If they were taught to beleeue and receiue the <hi>Cabala</hi> of the Iewes, the Alcoran of the Turkes, the Reuelations of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, the Traditions of the Papiſts, or ſuch like rotten traſh of mans deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: and if they were countenanced by authoritie of Princes, and Lawes of men, they were as eaſie to be wrought vpon, as waxe that is readie to receiue any ſtampe and impreſſion. A lamentable caſe, that wee ſhould bee ſtill as Babes and children, not knowing the right hand from the left, carried about with euerie waue of Doctrine, and receiuing the darkneſſe of errour for the light of the truth. But we haue not ſo learned Chriſt, and the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. When we haue once giuen entertainment vnto the truth, and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it ſoundly in our hearts, we muſt not denie the faith whatſoeuer befall vs, whatſoeuer trouble come vnto vs; whether proſperity fawne and flatter vpon vs, or whether aduerſity pinch vs, and paine vs; whether the Sunne of peace ſhine vpon vs, or whether the clouds of affliction ouer-ſhaddow vs, wee muſt alwayes be the ſame, and our ſtanding in the faith ſhould not be wauering or wandering, to giue ouer at euery aſſault, and to ſhrink backe for euery brunt, and to deny our Lorde and Maiſter by euery tentation. This ſerueth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue thoſe that knowe nothing, and therefore can profeſſe nothing; and as they know nothing, ſo they will know nothing, of whom we may ſay as the Apoſtle doth, <note n="ſ" place="margin">2 Pet. 3, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>This they wittingly know not, and ſo are wilfully ignorant, and ſhut their eies, becauſe they would not ſee, and becauſe the light ſhold not ſhine into their hearts.</hi> For ſeeing God hath commanded the light to ſhine out of darknes, we may truly ſay, <note n="t" place="margin">2 cor. 4, 3, 4, 6</note> 
                  <hi>If our Goſpell be then hid, it is hidde to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the mindes;</hi> that is, <hi>of the Infidels, that the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt (which is the Image of God) ſhoulde not ſhine vnto them.</hi> Thus doth God ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhold beleeue lies, <note n="u" place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2, 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>That all they might be damned which beleeued not the trueth, but had pleaſure in vnrighteouſneſſe.</hi> Let vs therefore ſeeke after knowledge, as for great Treaſures. Let vs ſearch the Scriptures, that in them we may find

It is not in all that know and acknowledge the truth, to auouch it, and to maintaine it, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it, and to ſtand to it: but onely of ſuch as haue receiued the ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power of Chriſt. Hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith of himſelfe, <note n="x" place="margin">Phil 4, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>I am able to doe all thinges, through the helpe of Chriſt which ſtrengthneth me.</hi> So he prayeth for the <hi>Coloſſians, That they might be ſtrengthned with the glorious power of Chriſt.</hi> When a man hath once receiued to beleeue, hee wanteth a new grace to bee giuen vnto him, that the graine of Faith which lyeth hidden in the heart, and couered in the Aſhes of mans frailty, may grow vp openly, and bring forth in vs the confeſſion of the mouth. This appeareth by the words of the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn,</hi> who teſtifieth; <note n="y" place="margin">Iohn 12, 42, 43.</note> 
                  <hi>That euen among the cheefe Rulers, many beleeued in him: neuertheleſſe, becauſe of the Phariſies they did not confeſſe him, leaſt they ſhould be caſt out of the Sinagogue: for they loued the praiſe of men, more then the praiſe of God.</hi> He ſpeaketh in this place of ſuch as were true belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, as appeareth both by the phraſe of ſpeaking, and the oppoſition, made betweene theſe, and thoſe that beleeued not <note n="z" place="margin">Verſe 37.</note> mentioned before. Verſe 37. where it is ſaid, <hi>That though he did many miracles before them, yet they beleeued not on him.</hi> The Euangeliſt noteth two lets and impediments that hindred them from the open manifeſtation of their Faith; to wit, the ſhame of the Croſſe, and the glory of the world.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, that ſometimes the deere Seruants of God are for a time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to confeſſe him, and to bewray themſelues what they holde, and how they beleeue. When <hi>Peter</hi> was come into the High-Prieſts Hall, and ſaw himſelfe in danger of death, he was ſo farre from confeſſing, that hee fell to open denying of his Mayſter; he beleeued in him (no doubt) in his hart, but he gaue not glory vnto him (as he ought) with his mouth. This wee haue heard to be in ſome of the bleſſed Martyrs, who gaue their liues to the death, they haue ſometimes ſtaggered, and felt the weakneſſe of the fleſh, before they haue beene throughly ſtrengthned in the Inner man. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and a Maiſter in <hi>Iſraell,</hi> &amp; bearing a loue vnto Chriſt, <note n="a" place="margin">Iohn 3, 2. &amp; 7, 50. &amp; 19, 38</note> came vnto him by night, and cloſely as it were by ſtealth. So <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Arama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia,</hi> was firſt a Diſciple of Chriſt ſecretly, for feare of the Iewes: yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward being ſtirred vp with thoſe things that they ſaw at the death and paſsion of Chriſt, both of them ſhewed themſelues more boldly &amp; confidently in his cauſe, and in the end forſooke all, to follow him, and reſolued to cleaue vnto him with the loſſe of all thinges that might be precious and deere vnto them. Such then as our Faith is, ſuch is our confeſsion. A weake Faith, a weake confeſsion: a ſtrong Faith, a ſtrong confeſsion: no Faith, no confeſsion: a ſtaggering Faith, a wauering confeſsion. Wherefore it belongeth vnto vs, to call vpon God to giue vs his Spirit, which is called <note n="b" place="margin">Eſay 11, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſpirit of ſtrength,</hi> whereby we ſhall bee inabled to beare the Croſſe patiently, and to confeſſe the Faith conſtantly. For when once wee are ſuſtained and ſupported by the Spirit of Chriſt, no Croſſe ſhall daunt vs, no tentation ſhall ouerwhelme vs, but we ſhall endure all thinges with a contented mind, and perſeuer vnto the end.</p>

                  <hi>Sanctifie the Lord in your hearts, and be readie alwayes to giue an anſwere to euerie man that asketh you a reaſon of the hope that is in you with meekeneſſe and reuerence.</hi> This conſtant and Chriſtian reſolution was in <hi>Paule,</hi> when he was brought before rulers for Chriſts ſake, though when he came to his anſwere no man aſsiſted him, but ſome fled from him, and others were aſhamed of him, yet he quit himſelfe like a man, and ſhewed himſelfe a faithfull witneſſe of that truth which hee belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.

Yet we heard before, that it is not enough for vs, not to deny the faith, but it is required of vs to confeſſe it.

                  <hi>That all the fearefull and vnbeleeuing, the abhominable and murtherers, the Whore-mongers, and Sorcerers, the Idolaters and lyars, ſhall haue their part in the Lake which bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with fire and Brimſtone, which is the ſecond death.</hi> Heere we ſee, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe wicked perſons which hee nameth, hee nameth in the firſt place fearefull perſons, which feare men more then God; theſe are ouercom by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and led to hell and deſtruction. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle chargeth vs (as we heard before) not onely to keepe our faith, <note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 10, 23.</note> but to keepe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of our faith. And <hi>Paule,</hi> when he came to his firſt anſwearing, dooth not reprooue the Brethren, becauſe they openly denied the Faith, but becauſe they ſecretly forſooke him, <note n="f" place="margin">2 Tim. 4, 16</note> and did not aſsiſt him, and he prayeth God that this ſin may not be laide to their charge. So the Angell of the Church of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus</hi> is commended, who dwelt where Satans throne was ſet vp, <note n="g" place="margin">Reuel. 2, 13.</note> becauſe hee kept the name of Chriſt, and denied not his Faith, euen in thoſe dayes when <hi>Antipas</hi> his faithfull Martyr was ſlaine, among them where Satan dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.

They haue borrowed many op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious tearmes, and drawne many reuiling tauntes from the enemies of the Goſpell, and grace of God, and apply them whete they ought not to bee beſtowed.

For our happineſſe ſtandeth and conſiſteth in two things, partly in our Communion with Chriſt our head, and partly in our coniunction and fellowſhippe with the members of Chriſt. Faith is that which vniteth vs with Chriſt our head: loue ioyneth vs together one with another, which are the members of his body. <note place="margin" type="runSum">

Among all the guifts of God which bring vnto vs a good report, the principall are to be a beleeuer in Chriſt, and to ſhew forth the fruits of mercy. This appeareth in all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the Fathers, and Patriarkes of elder times, that liued both before the flood, and ſince the flood, euen vnto the comming of Chriſt: for by it <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 11, 2.</note> our Elders were well reported of.

The more excellent theſe graces are in quality, the more they are in number, the greater they are in quantity, the better Teſtimony they giue vnto men, and the ſurer iudgement ariſeth from them, vnto ſuch as haue them.</p>

But the vngodly, as they diſhonour God in their liues, ſo he will diſhonour them in their perſons and names, and reward them with confuſion of faces.

So the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> teacheth, that faith in Chriſt, and Loue one toward another, are thinges euer ioyned together. <note n="d" place="margin">Iohn, 3. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>This is then his Commandement, that wee beleeue in the Name of his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, and loue one another as he gaue Commaundement.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaking of the effectuall faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> whereby he beleeued and was iuſtifyed, declareth that <note n="e" place="margin">Iam. 2. 22.</note>

Faith is the Tree, the Roote, the Fountaine, the cauſe: Loue is the Fruite, the Branch, the Streame, the effect.

                  <hi>For without Faith, it is vnpoſſible to pleaſe God, and whatſoeuer is not of Faith, is ſinne.</hi> All workes of Iuſtice, Mercy, Righteouſneſſe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the poore, to feed the hungry, to cloath the naked, without Fayth are nothing worth; nay all theſe beautifull ſhewes are beautifull ſinnes, except they be ſeaſoned with Faith. Againe, to afflict thy ſoule, to humble thy ſelfe, to heare the word, to receiue the Sacraments without Loue, that is, to do the duties of the firſt Table, and to neglect them of the ſecond Table, is but Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and maketh vs abhominable in the ſight of God. Seeing then, Faith and Loue are as the cauſe and the effect that liue together, &amp; ſeeing they looſe their Names and Natures, being diſioyned and diuided one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; wee ſee it euidently and ſtrongly to appeare, that Faith in Chriſt, and Loue to the Brethren, as Mother and Daughter, are ioyned together in euery true Chriſtian.</p>

               <p>Thus muſt theſe two be found in euery one of vs, for they meete together in all ſuch as ſhall be ſaued.

Hence it is, that the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith in his firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, <note n="o" place="margin">1 Iohn 4, 20 21.</note> 
                  <hi>If any man ſay, I Loue God, and hate his Brother, hee is a Lyar: for howe can hee that loueth not his Brother, whom hee hath ſeene; Loue God whom hee hath not ſeene?</hi> And this Commaundement haue wee of him, that he that loueth God, ſhould Loue his Brother alſo. Where hee teacheth, that the loue of God, and the loue of our Bretheren, are knit together with ſuch a faſt knot, as can neuer bee looſed and diſſolued, the Workes of the firſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cannot be pulled aſſunder from the Workes of the ſecond Table. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> moouing the diſperſed Iewes, to giue dilligence to make their Election ſure, and their calling certaine, that ſo they might neuer fall away, <note n="p" place="margin">2 Pet. 1, 5, 6, 7.</note> exhorteth them, <hi>To ioyne <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ertue with their Faith; and with Fayth, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and with Knowledge, Temperance; and with Temperance, Patience; and

It is not therefore enough for vs to haue one guift alone, and then think we are well. Let vs not flatter our ſelues, and boaſt of our Religion, to ſay wee haue Faith, or Knowledge, or Temperance, or Loue. Hee that hath but one of them, hath indeede none of them. We muſt haue many, or elſe wee cannot aſſure our ſelues, that we haue any at all. For, as hee that is refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in one ſinne, is reformed in all knowne ſinnes, and he that truely repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of one, truely repenteth of all: ſo hee that hath obtayned one gift, hath gotten many. One ſinne commonly goeth not alone, ſo one Vertue goeth not alone. When Fayth commeth, there commeth a Traine with it, it is as a Royall Queene, that neuer trauaileth abroad without her traine. Faith layeth holde vpon Chriſt, in whome <note n="q" place="margin">Col. 1, 19. &amp; 2, 3.</note> all Treaſures of Knowledge &amp; Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome are hidden: Whoſoeuer poſſeſſeth him, and hath him dwelling in his heart, hee poſſeſſeth all thinges. If then wee, by attending on the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, haue gotten Faith, <note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 20, 17.</note> which commeth by hearing, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by the Word; ſo ſoone as Faith is entred, a great multitude and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Armie of Gods Graces ſtande about vs, and throng at the doore of our hearts, as it were ſtriuing and thruſting, which of them ſhoulde enter firſt, and they neuer giue ouer, vntill they bee all come in, and haue taken vp their lodging there, neuer after to bee diſlodged and diſpoſſeſſed of that place.</p>
               <p>Let vs not therefore bee ſo ſparing and niggardly, to thinke one grace of God ſufficient for vs; we ſerue a liberall Lorde and bountifull Maiſter, that offereth to make vs partakers of all his Treaſures, and to beſtow vppon vs all the riches of his houſe.

The cauſe wil proue the effect, and the effect will manifeſt the cauſe. We may proue fire by the heat, and the heat by the fire; a good tree by his fruit, &amp; the fruit by his tree. Many wil ſeeme faithful &amp; religious, they will glorify that they beleeue, &amp; boaſt of their piety and godlineſſe; yet come to their liues, &amp; you ſhal find therein no fruits of mercy, no works of charity, no tokens &amp; teſtimonies of their loue appearing in them. This mans religion is in vaine, his faith is in vaine, his ſhew of godlineſſe is in vaine: for pure <note n="t" place="margin">Iam. 1, 27, &amp; 2, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and vndefiled before God the Father, is this, to viſit the fatherles &amp; widdowes in their aduerſity, &amp; to keep himſelf vnſpotted of the world.</hi> And the ſame Apoſtle in the next chapter teacheth; <hi>That it ſhal not profit any man to ſay he hath Faith, when his Faith bringeth forth no Good-workes.</hi> Againe, many will ſhew ſome fruites of Loue to their Brethren, in Almes, in liberality, in giuing vnto the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7222:63"/> poore, in dealing iuſtly and vprightly; and yet haue no faith, they doo them as naturall men, mooued by a naturall affection, or ſtirred vp by vaine glory, or hunting after the praiſe of men, or conſtrained by the lawes of Princes, or fearing the reproach of the world, or ſeeking the merit of their owne ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. All ſuch haue their reward according to their worke, but not according to their hope. They haue their reward already, they muſt look for no other; they haue it among men, they ſhall looſe it with God; they haue the applauſe of the world, but they muſt paſſe another doome in the life to come. Such faith (before ſpoken of) without loue, is but a ſhadow of faith; and ſuch loue without faith is but a ſhadow of loue, both are naught and nothing worth if they be aſſunder. The roote ioyned to the Tree are both good, and make the branches fruitfull, but ſeperate the one from the other, pull the root from the Tree, and you deſtroy them both, you kill them both. This is that vſe <note n="u" place="margin">Iames 2, 18.</note> which S. <hi>Iames</hi> vrgeth, chap. 2. <hi>Some man might ſay, Thou hast the Faith, and I haue workes: ſhew me thy faith out of thy workes, and I will ſhew thee my faith by my workes.</hi> Whereby we are taught to try the truth of our faith, &amp; the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of our loue, that we be not deceiued in the one, or in the other. But how ſhall this triall be made? Surely, by making one the Touchſtone to the other, laying one to the other, and waighing one in the ballance with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For the Apoſtle willeth the vaine Chriſtian, who hath nothing but the name of faith, to glory in (like a poore Begger that boaſteth of great riches) to ſhew the goodneſſe of his Faith by the fruits of Good-workes, or elſe his faith will appeare to be no faith, and his claime to be a falſe vſurpation. So then, if thou wilt prooue thy ſelfe a true Chriſtian, and to be iuſt before God through faith in Chriſt, it is not enough to take vnto thee the Title of fayth, and to boaſt of ſuch a beleefe as the Deuils haue, and euery reprobate may haue; but thou muſt be content to haue thy inward faith examined and tried by thy outward workes, whether it be the true faith or not. For a true Faith is alwayes ioyned with loue, and bringeth forth Good-workes, as neceſſarily as a good Tree bringeth forth good fruits. An euill Tree bringeth forth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill fruits, but a good Tree hath good fruite comming from it. From this coniunction of theſe two ſuperiour vertues, to wit, Faith and Loue; the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts in their tranſlation, and other Romaniſts in their diſputations, do debate and conclude againſt a fundamentall point of Chriſtian Religion, on this manner:

               </p>
               <p>To this Obiection I anſwere, they make an equiuocation in theſe words, [<hi>Faith alone.</hi>] If they meane by Faith alone, a dead faith (as Iames dooth) which is voyde of workes, then they ſpeake nothing to the purpoſe: for wee neuer allowed of ſuch a faith, we neuer taught iuſtification by ſuch a faith. But if they meane, as they ſhould if they reaſon againſt vs, that in the act of Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, there is required hope and charity, or any more then the hande of faith, which is the onely inſtrument to take hold of Chriſt: if they ioyne vnto this, any of their workes, we deny their aſſertion, and cannot admit of ſuch iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. For, we beleeue and hold it as a ſound foundation of our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that faith without any workes doth iuſtifye, foraſmuch as it dooth alone apprehend the mercies of God, and apply the merits of Chriſt, whereby wee are iuſtified: ſo, that if the queſtion be, what we muſt oppoſe between the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God and our ſinnes, why he doth not execute the curſe of the Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, wherefore he is reconciled toward ſinners, and receiueth them into fauour, and how they ſtand as iuſt before his Throne. Heere works haue no place, which are vnperfect, which are ſtained and defiled, ſo that both we and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7222:63" rendition="simple:additions"/> our workes muſt be accepted for another; namely, for Chriſts ſake, whome faith receiueth, and ſo putteth him and his benefits into our ſoules. True it is, Faith and Loue are alwayes ioyned in one Chriſtian, they are required to perfect him, and to bring him to ſaluation. Thus Faith is neceſſary, Hope is neceſſary, Charity is neceſſary; they muſt all concurre in one ſubiect, &amp; meet togither in the ſame perſon, ſo that no beleeuer muſt be without any of them. Thus we confeſſe they are neuer alone, he that is without Hope and Charitie is alſo without Faith; and whoſoeuer hath a liuely Faith, hath likewiſe an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall Hope, and a fruitfull Loue. Neuertheleſſe, howſoeuer they be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and muſt bee ioyned in the practiſe of a Chriſtian life, yet they are not ioyned, nor cannot be ioyned in the act and Article of Iuſtification. The eye in the head alone ſeeth, not the eare, not the mouth, not the tongue, and yet it is neuer alone in the head, but ioyned with others. The hand in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy alone ſerueth to handle and to take the meate whereby we are fed and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, yet it is not without the arme, without the foote, without the eye, without the head. Euery part and member of the bodie in his place is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and all ſerue to perfect the body, without which it were maimed and vnperfect, but euery member hath his ſeueral office and function: ſo is it with the gifts and graces of God, all are and ought to be ioyned together, to make vp a perfect Chriſtian, and he muſt be furniſhed with them to make him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and abſolute to euerie good worke; but euery gift hath his ſeuerall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and Office. The property of the eye is to ſee, of the hand to handle, of the foote to walke; ſo the Office of Faith is to make vs iuſt, the office of Hope is to make vs wait, the office of Loue is to make vs mercifull. We doo not ſeparate Faith and Good-workes from the exerciſe of a Chriſtian mans life, but in the office of Iuſtification, and acquitting of vs in the preſence of God. Faith in her Office is alone, as Loue likewiſe is in hers; but in our practiſe &amp; in our perſons they muſt be ioyned. A Prince, albeit in her eſtate &amp; Throne ſhe be alone, yet ſhe goeth not without her traine, and Maids of Honor, wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting about her, and attending vpon her. Faith, when ſhee layeth holde on Chriſt, and receyueth the promiſe, is as it were vpon her Throne of eſtate, and in her proper calling ioyning vs to God. Neyther do wee aſcribe our Iuſtification to faith for it ſelfe, or as it is a work and quality in vs, as if it were any part of our Iuſtice or righteouſneſſe, as if we were iuſtifyed partly by the merits of Chriſt, and partly by the worthineſſe of our own faith, for that were to ſeek Iuſtification in our ſelus, which is the Doctrine of the church of <hi>Rome:</hi> but we are iuſtifyed no otherwiſe by our faith, then wee are fed by our hand. Now how doth the hand nouriſh the body? Not becauſe it is meat to feed the dy, but becauſe it receyueth and applyeth vnto it the meate whereby it is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtayned. Euen ſo, Faith iuſtifyeth and giueth life, not becauſe it is our Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification either in whole or in part, but becauſe it receyueth Chriſt to be our righteouſneſſe and life, in whom <note n="x" place="margin">Acts 26, 18</note>

It is alone in our Iuſtification, it is not alone in our godly conuerſation: It is alone in receiuing Chriſt, it is not alone in furniſhing a Chriſtian mans life, nor ſufficient to adorne him with ſuch graces as God requireth to be in his perſon, for all other vertues muſt be in him.</p>

For he ſpeaketh in that place of a dead Faith, not a liuely Faith: of a falſe Faith, not of a true Faith: of the Faith of the Deuils, not of the Faith of Gods elect: of Faith in outward profeſſion, not in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affection. He ſheweth that <note n="e" place="margin">verſe 17.</note> Faith if it haue no workes is dead, and againe, <note n="f" place="margin">verſe 20. 26.</note> Faith without workes is dead: he likeneth ſuch a Faith to the Faith of the Deuils, and therefore it cannot be a iuſtifying Faith: vnleſſe they will make the Deuils good Catholiques, and partakers of ſaluation. He reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth this Faith to the good words of him that wiſheth well to a poore man, but doth nothing at all for him; he ſpeakes him faire, but he doth not ſuccour him. And as the body that breatheth not is dead, ſo Faith that bringeth not forth good workes is dead. Now a dead Faith, is no Faith: it is Faith in name, but not in Nature. The Philoſophers <note n="g" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ariſt. polit. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.</note> teach that when the body is dead, there ſhall be neither foot nor hand, but onely a likenes of name, as a man tearmeth a hand of wood or ſtone, a hand: ſo in like ſort is a dead hand called an hand, or a dead man, a man: becauſe howſoeuer they are not the ſame, yet they retaine the ſhew and ſhaddow of the name: but al true parts of the body are defined by their Office and faculty. Thus doth the Apoſtle call a dead faith by the name of faith, whereas indeed it is no more true faith then a dead man is a liuing man. Hence it is, that ſome of the Popiſh writers teach, that Iames by the name of <note n="h" place="margin">Iam. 2. 26.</note> ſpirit, vnderſtandeth not the ſoule, but the breath, and that he fitly compareth workes to breath, and faith to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: <note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Caietan com. on. Iam.</hi> 2. 26.</note> becauſe as the body of a liuing creature if it breath not is dead, ſo faith if it bring forth no workes is dead: for breathing is an effect of a liuing body, and working is the proper effect of a liuing faith: we ſay therefore, that there is a faith which may be without Charity, and there is a faith that cannot be without Charity. There is a generall faith which beleeueth that there is one God, and giueth aſſent that the Scriptures be true, which goeth no farther; this we confeſſe may be, and oftentimes is without good workes. But there is a faith that worketh by Loue, which can neuer be ſeperated from Charity and good workes, but whereſoeuer it is, there is infallibly and inſeparably ioyned vnto it the Loue of God and man, <note n="k" place="margin">Phil. 1. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>bringing forth the fruits of Righteouſneſſe, which are by Ieſus Chriſt to the glory and praiſe of God.</hi> If we haue this true faith <note n="l" place="margin">Act. 15. 9.</note> which purifieth the heart, it will be rich and plentifull in all good workes, and teach vs to ſhew the fruites of Loue to our Bretheren. There hath beene a long contention and much adoe in the Church, how to reconcile <hi>Paule</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the one aduancing faith, and the other good workes, <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith <note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 3. 28.</note> we are iuſtified by faith and not by the workes of the Law. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, wee are iuſtifyed by <note n="n" place="margin">Iam 2. 24.</note> workes and not by faith onely. Theſe ſayings by faith, and not by faith: by workes, and not by workes; ſeeme one directly oppoſite and contrary to the other. This difference is onely in the letter, not in the matter; in ſhew, not in ſubſtance: in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7222:64"/> words, not in meaning: and the Doctrine which now wee haue in hand, will helpe eaſily to accord them, nay there cannot be a better reconciliation, then when we ioyne them together in the practiſe of our liues and conuerſations. Let vs ioyne the liuely Faith of <hi>Paule</hi> with the Good-workes of <hi>Iames,</hi> let vs bring them both into action, and ſo we ſhall be iuſtified by S. <hi>Paules</hi> faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and by S. <hi>Iames</hi> Workes before men. Thus the places will eaſily be made one, which ſeeme different the one from the other. For, although <hi>Paule</hi> do commend Faith, yet he dooth not condemne Workes: and albeit <hi>Iames</hi> do commend Workes, yet he doth not condemn Faith; and therefore as they teach both, ſo we muſt practiſe both, we muſt be voyde of neyther of them. Seeing they preach both, we muſt know that both are required of vs. This ouerthroweth two ſorts of men; firſt, Papiſts; and then Libertines. <note place="margin" type="runSum">The firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe.</note> Firſt the Church of Rome do vs great wrong and iniury, both in falſly ſlandering vs, and in filling the eares of the ſimple and ignoraunt people with lyes, that our Doctrine is a Doctrine of liberty and licentiouſneſſe, that wee teach men, (or at leaſt open a gap to men) to liue looſely and lewdly, and that we are eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Good-workes, whereas in verie deede, we do the cleane contrarie, as this Doctrine among a thouſand others may beare witneſſe, which now wee deale withall, teaching vs that Faith muſt alwaies go with Works, that Faith purifieth the heart, and giueth victory ouer the world.

To be called Ieſus, is as it were the proper name of Chriſt, who is a perfect and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Sauiout, beginning, continuing, and finiſhing our ſaluation.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1.</note> Let vs ſee what are the Vſes of this Doctrine, and how wee may profitably apply it to our inſtruction and edification. Firſt, ſeeing it is our dutie to beleeue in Chriſt, we learne that Chriſt Ieſus is true and eternall God, equall with his Father, to be worſhipped and glorifyed together with the Father, &amp; the bleſſed ſpirit. This ſerueth to conuince the Hereſie of the Arrians, Iewes, Turkes, Perſians, and ſundry other Infidels, who deny the Deity of the ſonne of God, and caſt him downe into the row and ranke of meere creatures, who notwithſtanding <note n="f" place="margin">Phil. 2, 6, 10.</note> being in the forme of God, thought it no robberie to bee equall with God, at whoſe Name euery knee muſt bowe, both of thinges in Heauen, and things in earth, and things vnder the earth. Therefore, we ſaw before, that the Apoſtle in his ſalutation, wiſheth Grace and Peace to come vpon them, to whom he writeth this Epiſtle, as well from Ieſus Chriſt, as from God the Father. If Grace and Peace come not onely from the Father, but from the Sonne, it followeth that he is God equall with the other. Hence it is, that he ſayth in the Goſpell, <note n="g" place="margin">Iohn 14, 1. 11, and 12, 44. &amp; 10, 30 and 14, 11. &amp; 9, 38</note> 
                  <hi>Ye beleeue in God, beleeue alſo in mee, let not your heart be troubled.</hi> And againe, <hi>He that beleeueth in mee, beleeueth not in me</hi> (to wit, an ordinary man, as they falſly imagined) <hi>but in him that ſent me.</hi> And in another place, <hi>Beleeue me, that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me: I and my Father are one.</hi> So when Chriſt had reſtored ſight on the Saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oth day to him that was borne blinde, he ſayd; <hi>Lord I beleeue, and worſhipped him.</hi> Whereby we ſee, that whoſoeuer is without the Sonne, is alſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Father: he that beleeueth not in the Sonne, beleeueth not in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Hee that worſhippeth not the Sonne, Worſhippeth not the Father. So then, this is a certaine and inuincible Argument of the Deitie of Chriſt, that wee are to beleeue in him, foraſmuch as Faith is a Worſhippe due onely vnto God.</p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 2.</note> Secondly, ſeeing it is a principle neceſſarie to be holden of al men, that we muſt beleeue in the Son, we muſt put a difference betweene theſe ſayings; to beleeue God, &amp; to beleeue in God. For, albeit hee that beleeueth in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth God, yet it is not ſo on the contrary, euery one that beleeueth God, doth not by &amp; by beleeue in God. The Deuils themſelues (as we ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) do beleeue God, they beleeue Chriſt, they confeſſe him to bee the ſon of the Father, they know him to be the Iudge of the Worlde, the Sauiour of mankinde, the holy one of God; and yet they doo not beleeue in him, they put no confidence in him, they looke not for life and ſaluation from him, but are aſſured they are reſerued to deſtruction. This maketh them cry out in <note n="h" place="margin">Math. 8, 29.</note> the Goſpell, <hi>Why art thou come to torment vs before the time.</hi> And the apoſtle Iames ſayth, <note n="i" place="margin">Iames 2, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>The Deuils beleeue and tremble.</hi> They beleeue God touching his Nature and attributes; they beleeue Chriſt touching his Perſon, &amp; Natures, and Offices: They beleeue the Holy-Ghoſt touching his Perſon and Guifts: They beleeue there is a Church and ſingular prerogatiues imparted to it, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7222:66" rendition="simple:additions"/> beſtowed vpon it. And albeit our Faith muſt goe beyond the faith of the Deuils, yet they goe farther then many profeſſors of the Goſpell among vs, that haue no knowledge of theſe things. So then, it is required of vs, not onely to beleeue that there is a Sauiour of the world, but wee muſt beleeue that he is our Sauiour; beginning our ſaluation in this life, and perfecting it in the life to come.</p>
               <p>This confuteth the Popiſh opinion, that holdeth, that wee may beleeue in the creatures, as well as in the Creator: in the Saints, as well as in Chriſt: in mortall men, as well as in the eternall God.

                  <hi>How ſhall they beleeue in him of whom they haue not heard, how ſhall they heare without a Preacher, and how ſhall they preach except they be ſent?</hi> This place is not vnfitly called a Ladder that reacheth to Heauen, whereby as by certaine ſteppes we climbe vp to heauen. God ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, the Miniſter preacheth, the people beleeueth. The ſame Apoſtle asketh the Galathians, <note n="r" place="margin">Gal. 3, 2. Iohn 17, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether they receiued the ſpirit by the workes of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</hi> But the Faith which many talke and boaſt of, is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and conceited without the preaching of the worde, for they cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide it, they will not attend vnto it, they regard not to heare it. True it is, if they be asked whether they haue Faith or not, they will thinke it a ſtraunge queſtion, and maruell that we ſhold make doubt thereof, they ſuppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to haue a ſound Faith in Chriſt; but how come they by this faith? They ſay they beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt for their ſaluation, and yet they liue in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall neglect, and continuall contempt of the publicke Miniſterie of the word. Such is their beleeuing, as is their hearing; and their Faith is aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to their attending. It is a great fooliſhneſſe, &amp; worſe then mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for any man to imagine to attaine to Faith by any other meanes then God hath ordained. When God hath ſayde, that the ordinary way to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7222:66"/> Faith, is by the preaching of the worde: wilt thou in the high pride of thy ignorant heart ſay, I can haue Fayth without preaching? This is to croſſe the ordinance of God, and to thinke thy ſelfe wiſer then God. For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all haue not Faith that ordinarily heare; yet ordinarily none haue faith that doo not heare. If then we would haue Faith, we muſt ſeeke it as God hath appointed, where it is to be found; and when it is to be found, let vs be diligent hearers, attentiue hearers, conſtant hearers, and then we ſhal ſee the bleſſing of God vpon vs, that we ſhall be ſauing hearers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, true Faith is alſo ioyned with Prayer to God, and with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from dead workes: for how ſhall they call vpon him in whom they doe not beleeue? And the Apoſtle <note n="ſ" place="margin">Acts 15 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth, that Faith purifieth the hart. <hi>Paule</hi> exhorting the Elders of <hi>Epheſus</hi> ſaith, <note n="t" place="margin">Acts 20, 21</note> 
                  <hi>That he witneſſed both to the Iews and to the Grecians, the Repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> It was the ſubſtance of Chriſts Sermons, which he preached when hee came into <hi>Galile,</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Marke 1, 15</note> 
                  <hi>The Kingdome of God is at hand, repent and beleeue the Goſpell.</hi> But there are many amongeſt vs that profeſſe Faith, which haue a Faith of another kinde and Nature, it is not ioyned with inuocation of Gods name, they make no Conſcience to call vpon him, they haue not the Spirite of Prayer, that cryeth in their hearts, <hi>Abba</hi> Father: it worketh not in them conuerſion of heart, a turning of the minde, a chaunge of life: they boaſt of Faith, but they remaine the ſame men they were before, a deade life, a deade Faith; a prophane life, a falſe Fayth, that will in the end deceyue them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, true Faith worketh in vs an holy contentation in our eſtate, and teacheth vs to depend vpon Gods prouidence, touching Food, Raiment, and all things neceſſary for this preſent life. This Chriſt our Sauiour teacheth vs from the example of the Fowles of the Heauen, of the ſtature of our body, of the Lillies of the fielde, from the graſſe of the earth: what doo penſiue thoughts, diſtracting and diſtruſtfull cares auaile to ſuſtaine vs, or preſerue our life? Wherefore, ſeeing the Birdes are nouriſhed, our ſtature is encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the Lillies are beautified, the Graſſe is cloathed by the power and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, <note n="x" place="margin">Math. 6, 30. and 8, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Shall hee not do the ſame much more to you, O ye of little Faith?</hi> Faith therefore maketh vs reſt vpon God, want of Faith taketh away all truſt in him. But many among vs, that will needes boaſt of Fayth in Chriſt, want this Faith in his prouidence: for they dare not truſt GOD with their life, they doo not depend vpon him for their liuing, they are affraid he will leaue them, and forſake them, they do not beleeue he will bee a mercifull and gracious God vnto them, they haue not that affiance &amp; confidence repoſed him, that naturall children haue in their Parents. A Childe doth not wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie him-ſelfe with matters of the World, hee dooth not fore-caſt for manie yeares, hee is not intangled and choaked with earthly Cogitations, all his care is caſt vppon his Father, hee truſteth vppon him, hee knoweth hee will prouide for him, and ſo paſſeth his dayes without diſtruſt or diſpaire. And ſhall wee not be aſhamed, to bee ſent to Schoole to learne of little Children, that depend vpon their Father, whereas we haue not learned to lift vppe our eyes vnto our Father that dwelleth in the Heauens, but vſe vnlawfull meanes and vngodly ſhifts to helpe our ſelues. A plaine argument, that wee haue not that Faith, which we falſely imagine, and vainely imagine our ſelues to haue.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, true Faith is the Mother of loue, and maketh vs liue in peace one with another; the Apoſtle <note n="y" place="margin">Gala. 5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Paule</hi> teacheth, <hi>That Faith worketh by loue.</hi> And Iohn in his firſt Epiſtle ſaith, <note n="z" place="margin">1 Iohn 3, 23</note> 
                  <hi>This is his commandement, that we beleeue in the name of his ſon Ieſus Christ, &amp; loue one another.</hi> But many that wil ſeeme to haue faith in Chriſt, ſhew no fruits of loue toward their Brethren, they are not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful (if it be poſſible) and ſo farre as lieth in them, to haue peace with all men,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7222:67"/> they do not ſeeke after peace, and enſue it, but liue in hatred and contention, in malice and enuy, and leaſt of all do affect the children of God. An enuious Faith, is no Faith; and therefore, let ſuch men looke vnto it. Fiftly true faith is mingled with doubting and vnbeleefe, with wauering and feare, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtrongly ſhaken and aſſayled as with a mighty Tempeſt. This we ſee in the Father of him that was poſſeſſed with an vncleane ſpirit, he was readie to reſt vpon Chriſt, but he felt the fruite of his owne corruption, the ſpirit was willing, but the fleſh was weake, he found a fight within himſelfe, betweene Faith and Infidelity. When he conſidered the infinite power of Chriſt, that was able to caſt out Satan, and to binde the ſtrong man he was moued to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue. On the other ſide, when he ſaw the ſtrangeneſſe, the continuance, the incureableneſſe of his ſonnes diſeaſe, when he marked that the Deuill tooke him, tare him, caſt him into the fire to burne him, threw him into the water to drowne him, and at all times ſought to deſtroy him, when he beheld with the eyes of a Father that his childe fomed at the mouth; gnaſhed with his teeth, pined away in his body, and was bruiſed in his bones, hee was tempted with vnbeleefe, and this made him cry out with teares, <note n="a" place="margin">Marke 9, 24</note> 
                  <hi>Lord, I beleeue, helpe mine vnbeleefe.</hi> This is it wherein the Lord forewarned and fore-armed <hi>Peter,</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Luke 22, 32.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold, Satan hath deſired you to winnow you as Wheat, but I haue prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not.</hi> He prayed not that their Faith ſhould not be tried, but that it ſhould not be deſtroyed, foraſmuch as they muſt on euery ſide be aſſayled. But the Faith of many is ſuch, that they ſay they perfectly beleeue, and they thanke God they neuer doubted in all their life. This Fath is no Faith, it is an idle conceite, a vaine perſwaſion, a fooliſh preſumption. Laſtly, the true Faith encreaſeth by degrees, it is like vnto a graine of muſtard ſeede, which at the firſt is the leaſt of all ſeedes, <note n="c" place="margin">Math. 13, 31</note> which afterward groweth vnto a Tree, that the Birdes of the Ayre come and builde their Neſtes in it: and therefore, wee muſt <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 1, 17.</note> proceede from Faith to Faith. But many amongſt vs, that will needes be in the number of the faithfull, neuer feele theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Faith, they ſee not any encreaſing or decreaſing, any ſhining or ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſing of their Faith; Nay, they neuer examine themſelues whether they be in the Faith or not. They neuer conſider whether they go forwarde or backeward in the wayes of Godlineſſe: they can caſt vp their accounts eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Weeke with the worlde, but they can ſuffer whole moneths and yeares to paſſe ouer their heades, and neuer once offer to make leuell with the Lord. If wee will aſſure our owne hearts, that wee haue this true and perfect Faith in Chriſt, let vs obſerue the manner and meaſure of it, the ſteppes and degrees of it, how we walke by it, and labour by all holy meanes to encreaſe it in vs. Thus much touching the Obiect of Faith: Now, let vs conſider the Obiect of Loue.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">[<hi>Loue toward the Saints.</hi>]</q> The meaning of theſe words, is firſt to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, and then the Doctrines are to be gathred, which the Spirit of God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth in this place to our conſiderations. By loue, we are to vnderſtand the fruits of loue: mercy, conſolation, compaſſion, brotherly kindnes, reliefe, pity, and whatſoeuer fruits of charity we ſee them want &amp; ſtand in need of. It ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the affection of the mind, in the words of the mouth, and in the workes of the hand. By Saints, we do not vnderſtand ſuch as are deade and deceaſed, but thoſe that are liuing; not ſuch as are of the Church Triumphant, but in the Church Militant; not ſuch as are crownd with glory in heauen, but thoſe that dwell vpon the earth; not ſuch as are inrolled in the Popes Regiſter, and ſtand in redde Letters in the Popiſh Kalender; but the faithfull, whoſe Names are Written in the Booke of life, which are the true members of Ieſus Chriſt. Thus much touching the true Interpretation of the Wordes. We ſee heere that Loue is deſcribed by the Obiect thereof, to wit; the Saintes. For, as Chriſt is not the Obiect of our Charity, <note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 16 2.</note> for our wel-dooing extendeth not
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7222:67"/> vnto him: ſo the Saints are not the Obiect of our Faith, but as Faith hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and relation to Chriſt, ſo hath loue reference to the Saints. Now, we haue ſhewed already, that <hi>Philemons</hi> loue is commended toward the Saints, becauſe he had a principall and ſpeciall care of them. True it is, he neglected not others, but he was moſt of all mindfull of the godly, poore, and diſtreſſed Brethren. <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 8. The works of mercy are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to bee ſhewed to the poore that are godly.</note> We learne heereby, that the workes of mercy are eſpecially to be ſhewed to the poore among vs that are faithfull, which may bee accounted of the fellowſhip and Communion of the Saints. Howſoeuer all ſuch as are poore, are in their pouertie to bee regarded, inaſmuch as Chriſt hath taught vs that the poore we ſhall haue alwayes with vs, yet the Godly poore, that haue piety ioyned with their pouertie, are before others, and aboue others, to be reſpected and releeued.</p>
               <p>In the performance of this duty, we ſee the practiſe of the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> going before vs, <note n="a" place="margin">pſal. 16, 2, 3.</note> and leading vs the way. <hi>O my ſoule, thou haſt ſaid vnto the Lord, thou art my Lord, my well-dooing extendeth not to thee, but to the Saintes that are in the earth, and to the excellent: all my delight is in them.</hi> In like manner alſo, our Sauiour Chriſt deſcribing the manner of the laſt Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when hee ſhall giue to euerie one according to his Workes, <note n="b" place="margin">Math. 25, 40</note> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that the fruites of mercie beſtowed vpon the members of Chriſt, beeing ſicke, impriſoned, hungrie, thirſtie, naked, and in neceſſity, are allowed as notable fruites of a iuſtifying Faith, and of a true loue, and accepted as done to Chriſt himſelf. So the Euangeliſt Luke teſtifieth in the Acts, that <note n="c" place="margin">Acts 4, 32.</note> 
                  <hi>the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of them that beleeued were of one heart, and of one mind, they had all thinges common, no man accounted any thing he poſſeſſed his owne, but to ſerue the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary vſe of the Saints.</hi> The Apoſtle hauing prooued in the Epiſtle to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, that we are iuſtified freely by the grace of God, without the works of the Law, wherby we are at peace with God, commeth to ſet down the fruits of Faith, Chap. 12. <hi>Reioycing in hope, continuing in Prayer,</hi>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 1.</note> The Reaſons heereof are to be conſidered. Firſt, it is a fruit of our electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which we ought to aſſure to our ſelues more and more. The Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> teſtifieth this, <note n="f" place="margin">1 Iohn 3, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>We know that wee are tranſlated from death to life, becauſe wee loue the Brethren: he that loueth not his Brother, abideth in death.</hi> We ought daily to gather arguments to perſwade our hearts of Gods loue towardes vs, which we ſhall ſee by our loue toward our brethren. The election of God is hidden in himſelfe, the cauſe of it is not in our ſelues; but we ſhall not neede to climbe vp to Heauen to know it, God hath left vs a better, a more eaſie &amp; certain way then to ſearch into the ſecrets of God, that he hath kept to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, if we enter into our ſelues, and ſee the effects and ſignes of it, wee ſhall not doubt thereof, but reſt aſſured with vnſpeakable comfort that we belong to him. For as the Lord knoweth who are his, ſo we ſhall know that wee are the Lords, if wee finde the fruites of election grauen in our hearts, among the which this is one of the principall, our vnfaigned loue to the Brethren, the forgiuing of our enemies, our delight in the Saints, our dooing good to them that are of the houſhold of Faith.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 2.</note> Secondly, ſuch poore as be faithfull belong vnto Chriſt, and what comfort ſoeuer is miniſtred, what releefe ſoeuer is ſhewed to them, is miniſtred and ſhewd to Chriſt, as chriſt himſelf witneſſeth with his own mouth, who is truth
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7222:68"/> it ſelfe, that they ſhould the more readily embrace it as the truth. For hee telleth vs, that it ſhall be ſaid to vs in the laſt day, that haue helped the Saints, and refreſhed their bowels, <note n="g" place="margin">Math. 25, 40</note> 
                  <hi>Verily I ſay vnto you, inaſmuch as yee haue done it vnto one of the leaſt of theſe my Brethren, ye haue done it to me.</hi> This is a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble motiue and encouragement to moue vs to this dutie, to conſider that our loue is ſhewed not to men vpon the earth, but to Chriſt ſitting in heauen, at the right hande of his Father.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7222:69"/> Chriſt, by ſeperating our ſelues one from another in affection of heart, and practiſe of life! A true Chriſtian man or woman is like a Candle, that conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it ſelfe to giue light to others. So muſt Gods people ſpend thoſe gifts which God hath giuen them for the benefit of their Brethren. This <note n="ſ" place="margin" type="runSum">Wherein the communion of Saints ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</note> Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which we are to yeeld to the Saints, ſtandeth in two things; not to ſpeak of the Communion that we haue with Chriſt our head, but one toward ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Fitſt, in affection; Secondly, in gifts. In mind and affections wee muſt be of one heart, to mourne with them that doo lament, and to reioyce with thoſe that God doth comfort. We ſee this to be in the natural mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our body, if one member do ſuffer, the reſt are pained; if one reioyce, the other are comforted. This dutie the Apoſtle remembreth vnto vs, <note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 12, 15, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce with them that reioyce, and weepe with them that weepe: be of like affection one toward another.</hi> So the writer to the Hebrewes moueth vs <note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 13, 3.</note> to <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them that are in bonds, as though we were bound with them: and them that are in affliction, as if we were alſo afflicted in the body.</hi> If our ſelues were in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, we would haue a ſenſible feeling of our impriſonment, and wee would be readie to complaine of the want of the fruits of loue in others toward vs, if we were not viſited and comforted. Let vs therefore practiſe that toward others, which wee would haue practiſed toward our ſelues. This muſt all true Chriſtians haue in minde, that they muſt haue tender harts and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate affections, putting on the bowels of mercie and commiſſeration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in regard of the miſeries that befall the Church in generall, or our Brethren in particular. Chriſt Ieſus is touched with a feeling of their miſeries, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth them as done to himſelfe, as appeareth when he ſaid, <note n="x" place="margin">Acts 9, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Saule, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> This reprooueth thoſe that weepe when the Church reioyceth, or reioyce when the Church weepeth. The Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of this deadneſſe of hart in his dayes, <note n="y" place="margin">Amos 6, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>The people drank wine in bowls, they annointed themſelues with the chiefe oyntments, they ſtretched themſelues vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Beds of Iuory, but no man was ſorry for the affliction of Ioſeph.</hi> If we be not touched with a ſight &amp; ſence of the Churches miſeries, it is a plaine argument that we are dead members, not liuing; rotten members, not ſound; ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe members, not feeling. The ſecond part of the Communion of the Saints, ſtandeth in the communication of gifts. The gifts of God to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to our Brethren, are of two ſorts. For, as we conſiſt of two parts, the ſoule and the body, ſo the gifts are of two kinds, Spirituall graces, and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Bleſsings. Wee muſt beſtow vpon them ſpirituall gifts, procuring their good, by example, exhortation, comfort, prayer, reproofe. We are <note n="z" place="margin">Heb. 3, 13. Gal. 6, 1.</note> willed to exhort one another, while it is called to day: wee are admoniſhed, when any man is fallen by occaſion into any fault, as ſpiritual men to reſtore ſuch a one with meekneſſe, conſidering out ſelues, leaſt we alſo be tempted. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing temporal bleſſings, we muſt be ready &amp; content to beſtow ſuch goods as God hath beſtowed vpon vs, for the good of our fellow-members. If we haue this worlds good, we muſt not hide our compaſſion from them, for then wee cannot aſſure our ſelues that the loue of God dwelleth in vs.</p>

                  <hi>While we haue time, let vs do good vnto all men, but ſpecially to them that are of the houſhold of Faith.</hi> So the Apoſtle praieth for the Theſſalonians, that the Lord would encreaſe them and make them abound in Loue one toward ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and toward all men. Firſt it muſt extend to ſuch as are members of the Church, and afterward to all others. 1. Theſ. 3. 12. Loe heere is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God perpetually and inuiolably to be kept, as a Law of the Medes and Perſians which could not be altered: we muſt do good to the diſtreſſed Saintes and poore ſeruants of God before others and more then to others. God indeed is good to all, <note n="m" place="margin">Pſal. 125. 9.</note>

From hence ſuch as are poore and haue godlines laid vp in their hearts muſt learne, to beare the heauy burden of pouerty with patience, ſeeing that howſoeuer they are neglected of men in the daily miniſtration, yet they are highly reſpected of God, and he vouchſafeth to leaue ſpeciall direction for them aboue others, to be ſuſtained. The greater our pouerty is, the greater ſhould be our piety: that the more miſerable we ſeeme to the world, the more honourable we may be in the ſight of God and of all good men. True godlines will ſweeten the bitternes of the Croſſe, which hath the promiſes of this life and of that which is to come. But a poore eſtate ioyned with a prophane life, and extreame neceſſity accompanied with extreame iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and impiety, is a double miſery, a double wretchedneſſe, a double vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines. Let this therefore comfort vs, and temper the greatnes of our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeeing God doth care for vs aboue all his Creatures; yea, before the reſt of mankind, charging thoſe that are rich in this world to make a difference betweene man and man, betweene perſon and perſon, betweene poore and poore, euen ſuch a difference as he himſelfe hath made, who preferreth the ſheepe of his owne Paſture before Goates; the Sonnes and Daughters of his owne familie, before baſtards; the heires of his Kingdome before Aliens and ſtrangers; the veſſels of honour, before the veſſels of diſhonour. As for the poore that are wicked, vngodly, leud, and prophane, ſo long as they liue in their wickedneſſe, vngodlines, leudneſſe, and prophaneneſſe, they are no parts of Gods family, they are baſtards, not ſonnes; they are members of the Deuill, not members of Chriſt; they are cages of vncleane Birdes, not Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the holy Ghoſt; they are as dung and droſſe of the earth, not ſiluer and Gold for the Lords houſe. Seeing therefore God doth caſt them downe into the ſecond ranke, let not vs aduance them aboue their place. God is the God of order, not of confuſion: and if we be of God, let vs eſtabliſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs the order that he hath planted. Let vs iudge with righteous iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and lay all partiality aſide. Let vs not reſpect the poore becauſe they are our friends, but becauſe they are the freinds of God. Let vs not ſee to thoſe that are neerely alied to vs, but to thoſe that are of the kindred of Chriſt, which heare <note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 12, 50.

Heereby they ſhall be encouraged in well doing, and we ſhall by our godly care of them, prouoke them to greater zeale, and to a conſtant conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in their profeſſion. Wherefore let this be the rule to guide and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne vs: Such are to be vſed beſt which are indeed beſt, let them haue moſt releefe of the body, that haue moſt grace and godlines in the heart. Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes giueth the preheminence, and vngodlines bringeth reproach and ſetteth a note of infamy vpon his face that is defiled with it. True it is, others muſt

For where true Religion hath taken place, it will make them diligent in their buſines, and ſeruiceable to thoſe of whom they haue receiued good thinges. As for thoſe that are idle, and vnthankefull, they neuer taſted of ſound Religion, and do nothing elſe but abuſe their profeſſion.

Firſt, wee ſee plainely heereby, that there are Saintes vpon the earth; that is, men and woemen regenerate and ſanctified. The prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <note n="n" place="margin">Pſal 16. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>All my delight is in the Saintes that are vpon the earth,</hi> whereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that there are two ſorts of Saintes, one in heauen, the other on the earth: one ſort is the ſpirits of iuſt and perfect men, the other ſuch as are clothed with fleſh, who haue a righteouſnes begun in them but are yet farre from perfection: ſome that haue already receiued their Crownes, that are already glorified, not hauing ſpot or wrinkle or any ſuch thing; others that are yet in warfare againſt ſinne, the world, and the deuill, and carry about with them the remnants of naturall corruption. Therefore we profeſſe to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7222:71"/> beleeue in the Articles of our Faith, the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of Saints. So the Apoſtle ſaith, <note n="o" place="margin">1 Cor. 6, 1, 2, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Dare any of you hauing buſineſſe againſt another, be iudged vnder the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, and not vnder the Saints. Do ye not know that the Saints ſhall iudge the world?</hi> And afterward, <hi>Such were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are iuſtified in the name of the Lord Ieſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> This ſerueth to reprooue all thoſe, which in ſcorne and deriſion, mock the ſeruants of God, and vpbraide them with their profeſſion, ſaying; O you are a Saint, you are of the little flocke, you are an holy man; A yong Saint, an old deuil. Thus is Religion made a Prouerbe and common by-word, and thus are men come to ſit downe in the ſeate of Scorners: but heare this, O ye contemners of God! and know, that whoſoeuer is not holye, is prophane; he that is not pure, is impure; he that is not a Saint of God, is a bond-ſlaue of the Deuill: there is no meane betweene the one and the other. He that is not of the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle flocke of Sheepe, is of the great Heard of Goats, and of the multitude of vnbeleeuers that ſhall be condemned. He that entreth not in at the ſtraite gate that leadeth to life, walketh in the broad way, and entereth at the wide gate that leadeth to deſtruction. He that is not a Saint before hee dieth, is a Deuill incarnate before his death. This is that which our Sauiour ſpeaketh concerning Iudas, <note n="p" place="margin">Iohn 6, 70.</note> 
                  <hi>Haue I not choſen twelue, and one of you is a Deuill? Now he ſpake of Iudas Iſcariot, the ſonne of Simon, for he it was that ſhould betray him.</hi> This <hi>Iudas</hi> was not a Saint, and he is pronounced to be a Deuill. Now chooſe whether thou wilt be a Saint, or be accounted a Iudas, a Deuill, a member of the deuill. For, he that is not in ſome ſort changed, renewed, regenerated, and ſanctified in the inner man, ſhall neuer ſee life. If we begin not the way to ſaluation in this world, we ſhall neuer be receiued into glory in the world to come. This is the Doctrine which Chriſt preacheth to <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> 
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Iohn 3, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, verily. I ſay vnto thee, except that a man be borne of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdome of God.</hi> So the Apoſtle ſaith, <note n="r" place="margin">Ro. 8, 13, 14</note> 
                  <hi>If ye liue after the fleſh, ye ſhall die; but if ye mortifie the deeds of the body by the ſpirit, ye ſhal liue: for as many as are led by the ſpirit of God, they are the ſonnes of God.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <note n="ſ" place="margin">2 Cor. 5, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Thus we iudge, that if one be dead, and he died for all, that they which liue ſhould not henceforth liue vnto themſelues, but vnto him which died for them, and roſe againe.</hi> Sanctification goeth alwayes before glorification. Euerie one would be glorified, but euery one wil not be ſanctified: euerie one would liue with God, but euery one will not dye to ſinne: euery one would receiue the victory, but euery one will not fight the battel. But let vs not be deceiued, God is not mocked. If we would attaine to ſaluation, we muſt firſt haue ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, we muſt be Saints in this life; if we look to be Saints in glory heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; we muſt be Saints vpon the earth, if we would be Saints in heauen; wee muſt firſt make a beginning, before we can come to the ending. We muſt take paines, wee muſt labour hard, and ſweate much, before we can come to our iourneyes end.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore take heed we do not make a mocke of the Saints, leaſt we mocke at our owne ſanctification, and conſequently neglect, nay deſpiſe our owne ſaluation. If we make any account of holineſſe of life, let vs not caſt it out as a reproch, to bee holy. Let vs conſider, that this is the will of God, euen our ſanctification; it is not therefore his will that wee ſhould delight in prophaneſſe, and vngodlineſſe. And as for thoſe that are ſcorned and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or rather not they, indeede, or their perſons flouted and contemned, but their Faith, their Religion, their Sanctification: let them not hang downe their heads, and be diſcouraged, but walke boldly through good report and euill report, and be ſo farre from ſhrinking back for theſe taunts &amp; reuilings, that rather we ſhould prepare our ſelues for an harder battell, &amp; an hotter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter. We haue not yet reſiſted vnto blood. Remember what our Lorde and Maiſter hath endured, the reproach of the world, the ſlaunders of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7222:72"/> the mockings of the malicious, the ſhame of the croſſe, and what not. We muſt not looke to fare better then he, we muſt not thinke to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained otherwiſe then he was. If this be the worſt that they can ſay by vs, if this be the greateſt fault they can report of vs, that we are Saintes and holy perſons, let vs not be diſcomforted, but rather comforted heerein, that God is glorified in vs, his name is honoured, and the mouth of Iniquity is ſtopped, hauing nothing to detect vs off, nothing to obiect againſt vs. The enemies of <hi>Daniell,</hi> howſoeuer they watched all occaſions and ſought all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to betray him and deſtroy him, yet the greateſt crime they had to charge him withall, <note n="t" place="margin">Dan 6. 11. and 3. 12.</note> was, that he prayed to his God three times a day, and made ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication vnto him. The <hi>Caldeans</hi> had no other fault to charge the <hi>Iewes</hi> to haue committed, then that they would not bow downe vnto an Idol. If they could haue found any other matter to accuſe them of, as Malefactors, their malice was ſo great to their profeſſion and to their perſons, for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions ſake, that they would not haue ſpared and held their peace. But this was the glory of theſe ſeruants of God, that they ſuffered not for their ſinnes and deſeruings, but for their faith, and a good conſcience.

Hence it is, that they adde farther, that our Church cannot be an holy Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was neuer yet any Saint or holy man of it, approued to be ſuch by miracle or any other euident token. They renounce our Church, becauſe it is no holy Church, and they conclude it is not holy, becauſe we haue no Saints that are in it or euer were of it. Firſt, lct vs ſpeake of our Saintes, and then ſomewhat touching their Saintes, whereof they boaſt ſo much, and in whom they glory ſo greatly. Touching the former, the Prophets, Apoſtles, and holy men of the firſt Churches, were profeſſors of the ſame faith that wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, as appeareth by the Scriptures, by which we offer to be tried in al con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies; but our Aduerſaries will not deny theſe to be Saintes, and ſuch Saintes as haue beene approued by miracles. Againe, we haue in our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches true beleeuers, iuſtified by the bloud of Chriſt, and ſanctified by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and therefore are Saintes by calling, as we haue ſhewed before. We haue the fruites of ſanctification, as neceſſary effects of a liuing faith, we profit daily in repentance from dead workes, we labour more and more for <note n="y" place="margin">Col 2, 2. 5.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7222:72"/> But ſuch as liue in ſin, and walk in the fleſh, haue not the ſpirit of Chriſt, they are not of our church, they are no true Saints; they may bee among vs, but they are not of vs. As for the popiſh Saints which are found in their Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Legend (ſo called) and ſtand in redde letters in their Kalenders, it is no maruell if we do not account of them, when <note n="a" place="margin">

                  </note> many among themſelues doo ſeeme not much to reſpect them; and affirme, that the Saints canonized may be no Saints, and the myracles whereupon it is grounded, no myracles. And becauſe the Church of Rome ſpeaking of Saints doo alwayes meane ſuch as are in the Popes Kalender, and of his canonization (who is now helde to be the onely Saint-maker vpon the earth) and propound ſuch to the people, to the honoured and worſhipped, let vs conſider a little what thoſe Saints are, &amp; whom they adore and call vpon. Our Sauiour Chriſt accuſeth and reproueth be Samaritans, <note n="b" place="margin">Iohn 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe they worſhipped the thing which they knew not:</hi> a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip they performed, but they knew not what. But this falleth flatly and fully vpon the papiſts heads, for they worſhip many fictions for Saints, &amp; ſhadows for men; whereas there were neuer any ſuch that liued vpon the earth. It were eaſie to alledge ſundry of this ſtampe, but a fewe ſhall ſerue and ſuffice inſted of many. Saint <hi>George</hi> is worſhipped among the Papiſts, as a renowned Saint, but ſuch a Saint as they report and receiue this <hi>George</hi> to be, was neuer extant in the world, who is ſaide to haue killed a Dragon, that was ſo big, that foure yoake of Oxen could hardly draw him out of the City, which <note n="c" place="margin">

Secondly, S. <hi>Christopher</hi> is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly adored by the Church of Rome, who is reported of ſome to be a man of twelue foot long, and of other to be twelue cubits high: this is he that went vp and downe to ſeeke the Deuill to ſerue him; for he ſaid, <hi>I go to ſeek my Lord the Deuill to ſerue him.</hi> If this were a Saint, hee was one of the Deuilles Saints, whom he ſerued, and called him Lord, and not one of Gods Saints. The like we might ſay of S. <hi>Catherine,</hi> and infinit other, whome falſhood hath forged and deuiſed, and ſuperſtition noriſhed and retained. Moreouer, their Legends of Saints are ſo full of fables and fooleries, that they doe not onely ſet them downe for Martyrs, which neuer had being in the worlde, but they adore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly for Saints and Martirs, thoſe which (by the confeſſion of their wiſeſt writers) were pagans &amp; Iewes, traitors &amp; hereticks, men of a wicked life, &amp; of a doubtful faith: what was the ſoldier I pray you, that pierced the ſide of chriſt, but an Infidel? for otherwiſe he would neuer haue thruſt his ſpeare ſo ſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and offred that villany and violence to the body of our bleſſed ſauiour; yea, it may probably appeare &amp; be gathered out of the ſcripture, <note n="d" place="margin">Reuel 1, 7.</note> that hee was not only a curſed vnbeleeuer, but a damned wretch &amp; reprobate: and no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued hiſtory maketh mention of his calling and conuerſion, yet the blinde ignorant papiſts do worſhip this ſouldier as a Saint, vnder the name of <hi>Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> what is this but to make Pagans and Infidels Saints; yea, when ſo manie dead mens bones and blood, their reliques and aſhes, are worſhipped in euery coaſt and corner where popery raigneth; what aſſurance can any man haue, that he doth not worſhip the bones &amp; bodies of pagans &amp; heathens? <hi>Gama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liell</hi> mentioned in the Acts, was an incredulous Iew, &amp; a right Phariſee, <note n="e" place="margin">Acts 5, 39.</note> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the counſel which he gaue to the Iewes in the Counſel, fit for a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician, vnfit for a Chriſtian; ſhewing rather a wily &amp; witty head, then a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious hart, &amp; if he had beleeued in Chriſt, he wold not haue feared to confeſſe his name; yet hath he a place among the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Saints, and reuerently are his relicks eſteemed of them.

The time will not ſuffer vs to make a Catalogue of theſe their Saints, but this may ſuffice to ſhewe, that the Papiſts honour diuers Saints, which neuer liued in the world, but are meerely fanſied and fondly imagined: others, that are doubtful, &amp; not certainly known to be ſuch as they are reported: others likewiſe, that were pagans in ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Iewes in religion, Hereticks in profeſſion, traiotrs in practiſe, and wicked men in their conuerſation; of whoſe damnation in hel there is more certainty, then either of their faith in earth, or ſaluation in heauen.

                  <hi>and beare much fruite euen in our old age.</hi> Many that are barren in bearing good fruit, are too fruitful in bringing forth the vnſauoury fruits of the fleſh, which the Apoſtle nameth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. who may iuſtly feare the curſe that God <note n="l" place="margin">Luke 13, 7.</note> laid vpon the Figtree, and euery day look to be hewne downe and caſt into the fire.

               <p>Where we ſee, that Gods Children are neuer void of the fruits of faith, but haue them in them to their endleſſe comfort. Other Trees oftentimes fall to degenerate and grow out of kinde; and if they do holde out, yet age maketh them decay and dye, albeit you digge, and dung, and water them neuer ſo much, it cannot keepe them from waſting and withering; it is not ſo with the faithfull, which are planted in his Church, as it were in his Garden, euen

Theſe walk in the fleſh, and ſauor nothing but of the fleſh, and therefore of the fleſh ſhall reape corruption.

                  <hi>There ſhall be no more there a child of years, nor an olde man that hath not filled his daies: for he that ſhall be an hundred yeare old, ſhall die as a young man, but the ſinner being an hundred yeares old, ſhall be accurſed.</hi> The faithfull in Chriſts kingdom ſhal flouriſh through his gifts, &amp; be bleſſed of God: but ſuch as are vnfruitfull are accurſed, &amp; albeit they ſeeme for a time freſh and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, yet they are no better in the ſight of God then dead carkaſſes, and ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king carrions.

The <note n="q" place="margin">Pſal. 16, 3. &amp; 119, 63.</note> delight of the Prophet was in the Saints. He profeſſeth himſelfe to be a companion of al them that feare the Lord, and keep his precepts. The coniunction &amp; communion of the faithful is threefold, in piety, in amity, in glory. In piety, becauſe the harts of the faithful are ioyned together in faith, &amp; in the feare of God. In amity, becauſe they loue togither as children of the ſame father, knowing that heerby we ſhalbe known to be the diſciples of Chriſt, if we loue one another. In glory, becauſe they are heirs of the ſame kingdom where are many manſion places prepared for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be partakers with the children of God in eternall happines in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens (as al men wil ſeeme deſirous of bleſſednes) we muſt be vnited to them in a godly life, &amp; in Chriſtian loue: we are willing to hear of felicity, but we care not for the practiſe of piety, or for walking in charity. <hi>Balaam,</hi> that was hyred with the wages of iniquity to curſe the people of God, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaw the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly order among them, cried out, <note n="r" place="margin">Num. 23, 10</note> 
                  <hi>Let my ſoule die the death of the righteous, and let my laſt end be like his.</hi> He deſired to communicate with the godly in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, but he would not ioyn with them in a reformed life. But it is neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required of vs to be linked to them in loue, to be of one heart, and to be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with them in godlyneſſe, to be of one faith, if euer we look to enioy with them the ſame inheritance of immortality. Such therefore, as will neyther be friends and familiars with them, but hate and abhor them worſe then a Dog or a Serpent, nor be Worſhippers of God with them, reforming their liues, &amp; repenting from Dead-works, but follow the luſts of the fleſh with greedines,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7222:74"/> and draw iniquity as with cartropes muſt know, that they ſhut out themſelus from the kingdom of heauen, &amp; ſhal not aſcend with them into the mountain of God. Now, as the faithful delight in thoſe that are faithful, and the godly in ſuch as are godly, ſo they account it a great griefe to be among the vngodlie, where they ſhall ſee much iniquity, and heare God diſhonored, &amp; feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues many waies indangered. This made the Prophet lament his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <note n="r" place="margin">Pſal. 120, 5, 6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Woe is to me, that I remaine in Meſhech, &amp; dwell in the tents of Kedar; my ſoule hath too long dwelt with him that hateth peace: I ſeeke peace, &amp; when I ſpeake thereof, they are bent to warre.</hi> Theſe corrupt and contagious ſocieties, are manifold in the world, which we are to auoid more then a place of infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that may indanger the body, among the which there is a knot and band of ſuch leud companions, and looſe mates, as accompany together in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gaming, ſwearing, whoring, rioting, reuelling, and railing at all religion, and at the ſeruants of God that are the profeſſors of religion. This ſociety in euill is to be found in euery place, but this ſociety is not of God, but of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill: it is not the communion of Saints, but the company of ſinners that make a practiſe of all wickednes. Againe, there is another ſort, who albeit they bee not ſo fully &amp; fouly diſordered, yet are as far from the kingdom of God. For, when they ſhould accompany the faithful in the aſſembly of the Saints, they keep company with their catle, beaſts, &amp; ſwine. When the faithful on the lords day, are going into the houſe of God, they are going into their fieldes; when they ſhould be with their brethren, they are looking on their bullocks, &amp; ſhew no more conſcience to religion, then if they had no other ſoules, then their Swine or dogs haue. A lamentable caſe, that ſuch prophaneſſe ſhold be found in places where the precious word of God is preached, and yet it were eaſie to point out ſuch prophan perſons among vs. Theſe haue the harts of <hi>Eſau,</hi>

And yet if a ſuruey of moſt of our pariſhes were made, &amp; a view taken of them, it is to be feared, that both theſe ſorts would take vp the greateſt company, and the feweſt ſort be found of thoſe that with good &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt harts, attend to the word with diligence and reuerence. Theſe men that thus abſent themſelues from the church of God, deſerue to be ſeparated from the Saints and Sacraments, from the word and prayers, that they may learne not to be ſo prophane, and be aſhamed of their euill.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The method and meaning of the words.</note> IN this place we haue the ſhutting vp of the entrance of this Epiſtle. Wee heard before how <hi>Paul</hi> gaue thanks to God for <hi>Philemon,</hi> he praied for him, &amp; that daily: he praiſed greatly his Faith toward Chriſt, and his Loue toward the Saints, that is, the poore and diſtreſſed chriſtians. Theſe words do depend vpon the fourth verſe. For we muſt know that the Apoſtle goeth not on in the praiſe and commendation of <hi>Philemon</hi> begun in the former verſe, magnifying his Faith and Loue whereof hee had heard by the report of the Church; but they agree with that which he had ſpoken before; namely, that he is mindfull of him in his Prayers. For, if it bee asked, for what cauſe did hee pray for <hi>Philemon?</hi> The anſwer is, to the end that his Faith ſhewing forth good fruites might not be found counterfetted, but approued to be true. We haue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7222:74"/> in theſe two verſes, theſe two things to conſider; firſt, what was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his prayers, what was the ſubſtaunce and contents of them; to wit, that he might manifeſt his Faith, not to lye ydle, but to be extended to others. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the reaſon why he made that, the matter of his praiers, &amp; wherefore he prayeth that his faith might be effectual. Touching the firſt point, which is the matter of his praiers, he craued two things; firſt, that his faith might bee made common to many, &amp; the benefit of it might comfortably flow to the refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many ſoules. For although faith haue her ſecret and hidden dwelling in the hart, yet the fruits of it are imparted to others: Secondly, that it might be effectual; now faith is effectual when it worketh by Loue, &amp; bringeth foorth good works to the releeuing of others; as if the Apoſtle ſhold haue ſaid, that thy Faith by communicating it ſelfe to others, &amp; not remaining with thy ſelfe alone, may more &amp; more ſhew the vertue, force, and power therof, in al good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Thus he praieth not only for grace, but for the increaſe of grace to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto him. Then he declareth wherein this effectuall faith ſtandeth &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth; to wit, in the acknowledging of thoſe good things which were in him, that ſo they may be brought into the light to be ſeen of al men, &amp; to be felt of thoſe that were in need. For the apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> (as we haue ſhewed) calleth that not an effectual or liuing faith, <note n="t" place="margin">Iames 2, 20.</note> but a dead &amp; idle faith, which is not declared and profeſſed by works. In the laſt place he addeth <hi>(through Ieſus Chriſt)</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he meaneth, that whatſoeuer good thing we haue in vs, we haue it by chriſt without whom we haue nothing that is good. Touching the ſecond point, which is the reaſon why he praieth for an effectuall Faith in him, becauſe the loue that appeared to be in him, had wrought great ioy and gladneſſe of hart in him, which loue of his he commendeth by the effect, <hi>The bowels of the Saints were comforted through him.</hi> This fact of his, the Apoſtle commendeth, firſt, by the conſideration of the perſons to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his loue was manifeſted, not to thoſe out of the church, but to the ſaints. For charity to the Saints is to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, inaſmuch, as it cannot be beſtowed on a better ſubiect; they do ſtand in the place of Chriſt, who accepteth of our loue &amp; liberality as extended toward himſelfe. Secondly, his loue is commended by the name of bowels, wherby the extreame neceſſity of the Saints is ſignified, who were (as it were) pained in their bowels and inward parts. Now, the great pouerty &amp; penury of thoſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom we beſtow our charity, increaſeth and maketh it the greater. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note n="u" place="margin">Math. 11, 28</note> the word of comforting, refreſhing, and cherriſhing the heart, is a matter of great commendation. For it is no ſmal thing to comfort and ſtrengthen the weak and feeble, and to giue reſt to the ſoul &amp; body, that hath bin toſt &amp; tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with much affliction. Thus doth the Apoſtle ſet forth the fruits of <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> loue moſt effectualy. This is to be obſerued of vs concerning the method and meaning of theſe words, which are thus much in effect; If thou wouldeſt more fully know the cauſe of my giuing thanks, and the remembrance of thee in my praiers, ſurely it is this, that as God in mercy hath beſtowed vpon thee a true ſauing faith, ſo my earneſt deſire and humble requeſt is vnto him, that the offices, fruits, and duties of thy faith may bee more and more communicated and fitted to the benefit of the poore Saints; that ſo whatſoeuer good thing is to be found in thee through the grace and working of Ieſus Chriſt, may bee acknowledged, manifeſted, and publiſhed abroade, to the glory of God, the comfort of the faithful, and the prouocation of others. For indeed thy loue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me great occaſion of much ioy, becauſe thou (my brother) doſt not only cheere the Saints, and reioyceſt them, but cauſe their very harts and bowels, euen their ſecret and inward parts to be refreſhed &amp; reioyced. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Diuers points to be obſerued out of theſe Verſes.</note> But before we handle the doctrines ariſing in this diuiſion, it ſhal not be amiſſe a litle to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the force of the words, and the maner that <hi>Paule</hi> hath obſerued in the penning of them. Firſt obſerue, that he ſaith not ſimply, <hi>thy faith may bee made effectuall,</hi> but [<hi>The fellowſhip of thy Faith</hi>] that the fruit thereof might redown
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7222:75"/> and returne to many. Secondly, he ſaith not barely [<hi>That his Faith might be knowne,</hi>] but [<hi>Euery good thing,</hi>] that is; euery grace that was in his heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when Faith is made knowne to others, and brought into ſight &amp; open light: many other guifts of the Holy-Ghoſt are made knowne, as Loue, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Liberality, and ſuch like. For the grace of Faith is neuer alone in the heart, but is garded with a troope and company of all other vertues, and when it commeth as it were out of the doores, it commeth abroad with a band and traine of all other graces. Thirdly, he declareth the author and cauſe of all theſe bleſſings, from whence they proceed, to wit; from Chriſt, that we ſhold learne not to thinke or ſpeake of any benefite, without making mention of Chriſt. Fourthly, he draweth an argument or reaſon why hee prayed for the efficacy of his Faith, from the former experience of his Loue, which was as effectuall as his Faith, teaching that the experience of grace already giuen, ſhould mooue vs to begge and craue the encreaſe of that Grace, and a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance and continuance in that grace: and therefore, wee muſt not bee ſo ſimple or ſenceleſſe to imagine, when we ſee grace beſtowed vpon any man, that we haue no more neede to pray for the encreaſing and growing of that grace. For, wee muſt know, that there are degrees of grace, there is a firſt Grace, there is a ſecond Grace. Now, that Grace may bee multiplyed, and a continuall encreaſe and acceſſe to it may be added: we muſt make daily prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, we muſt pray that we may haue Faith, and when we haue it, we muſt not be ſecure, but pray that it may be effectuall and working by loue. Laſt of al, in the commending of <hi>Philemons</hi> liberality, <note n="x" place="margin">
                     <hi>Theophil. in hunc locum.</hi>

Now let vs come to the Doctrines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the fellowſhip of thy Faith may bee made effectuall.</hi> Heere the Apoſtle remembreth the matter and ſubſtance of his prayer, what it was that hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought and requeſted of God; where we ſee hee affirmeth that it conſiſted in this, that the fruits of his Faith might be encreaſed, &amp; continually augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <note place="margin" type="runSum">

The growing and proceeding of our brethren in the beſt things ſhould be ſought for of vs. When <hi>Moſes</hi> had word brought vnto him, that ſom in the hoſt did propheſy; that is, had receiued no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table gifts of the ſpirit, for the guiding and directing of his people, he ſaide, <note n="a" place="margin">Num. 12, 29</note> 
                  <hi>I would to God, that not only theſe, but that all the Lords people were Prophets, and that he would poure out his ſpirit vpon them.</hi> The Apoſtle writing to the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians,</hi> ſaith, <note n="b" place="margin">1 Theſſ. 4, 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Furthermore, I beſeech you Brethren, and exhort you in the Lord Ieſus, that ye encreaſe more and more, as ye haue receiued of vs how yee ought to walke, and to pleaſe God.</hi> They had encreaſed already exceedingly, they had gained in the Faith, and were growne to a perfect age, they receiue this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony and commendation, <note n="c" place="margin">1 Theſſ. 1, 6, 7, 8. &amp; 2, 13. &amp; 5, 1, 2. &amp; 4, 9, 10. &amp; 3, 10, 11</note> that they became followers of the Apoſtles &amp; of the Lord; They receiued the word in much affliction with ioy of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Ghoſt; They were as enſamples to all that beleeue in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> from them ſounded out the word into al quarters; they receiued it, not as the word of men, but as it is indeede the word of God, which worketh in them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue. Touching the times and ſeaſons, he had no neede to write vnto them, becauſe they knew perfectly that the day of the Lord ſhould come as a theef in the night Touching brotherly loue, they had no neede he ſhould write vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, for they were taught of God to loue one another: &amp; yet he prayeth to God ſtill to encreaſe them, and make them abound in loue one towardes another, and toward all men; yea, he deſired exceedingly night and day, that

So muſt wee grow in grace, vntill we come to a perfect aged man in Chriſt. The Prophet ſpeaking of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that were zealous in the worſhip of God, ſaith, <note n="g" place="margin">Pſal. 84, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>They goe from ſtrength to ſtrength.</hi> So the Apoſtle exhorteth, that we <note n="h" place="margin">1 Cor. 14, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhould not be Children in vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but as concerning maliciouſneſſe we ſhould be Children, but in vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we ſhould be of ripe age.</hi> He would haue vs as Children, and he would not haue vs as Children: he would haue vs Children in malice, but he would not haue vs Children in knowledge.

Thus hee would haue vs to bee children, but in wiſedome, in knowledge, and in vnderſtanding, he would haue vs to be of ripe age, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede in theſe gifts, as we do in our yeares.

Staying in one ſtate is a token of reprobation and reiection from God, they are caſt into a ſpirite of ſlumber and drowſineſſe, they ſleep in ſecurity, and cannot ſee their way.

Firſt we learne, that God hath a iuſt action and ſuit to commence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all idle bellies, and vnprofitable Drones, that be Truants and no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficients in the Schoole of Chriſt. The church of God is the Schoole of Chrſt, he is the Maiſter, all of vs are or ſhould be his Schollers. We are brought forth into the world, that when we come to yeares of vnderſtanding, we may be Schollers in his Schoole. If any of vs put our Children to a free Schoole to be taught, if they ſhould ſtill ſtay and ſtand in the loweſt forme, and neuer a whit proceede in learning, we would iudge them either void of ordinary diligence, or deſtitute of ordinary capacity. We looke when we ſet them to Schoole, that they ſhould encreaſe in learning. We haue a common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, that Schollers of all other haue the beſt conſcience, that whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers neuer thinke they haue enough, they thinke they haue to much for their mony. But let vs ſee how it fareth with vs, who are likewiſe Schollers in the beſt Schoole that euer was, the Church of God: and haue the beſt Maſter that euer was; to wit, Chriſt himſelfe. God hath put vs to Schoole to learne at the mouth of Chriſt, who hath committed vs to Paſtors and teachers, as to his Deputies to be inſtructed. It is required of vs, that we grow in knowledge, in faith, in zeale, in obedience, and in all the workes of ſanctification. If we be good Schollers, we muſt grow forward and aſcend higher, we muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from grace to grace, and from one ſtep to another. But alaſſe, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are there in our congregations, who hauing liued vnder the Goſpell, that offereth ſaluation to men all the daies of their life, and continued ten, twenty, thirty, forty yeares, hearing the word of God ſounding in their eares, <note n="m" place="margin">Ephe 4, 14.</note> yet are no wiſer in Religion then a young Child, and are no forwarder then when they firſt ſtepped and entred into the Schoole-houſe of God. I doubt not but they are wiſe in matters of the world, but in the booke of God and in matters of their ſaluation they haue no knowledge. They receiue the grace of God in vaine, and are Dunſes and Dwarfes in this Schoole of Chriſt; without growing and encreaſing in Godlineſſe. They are not in truth able to ſay vnto their owne Soules, I haue receiued ſome grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meaſure of knowledge, I haue attained better ſtrength of Faith, I haue found ſome increaſe in Godlineſſe, I haue felt ſome care and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to pleaſe God. Nay we may truely ſay, that many are more ignorant in knowledge, more lewd in life, more backward in good thinges, more prophane in heart, more contemning the word of God, and loathing the meanes of ſaluation, then they were in the beginning of their dayes. This is our eſtate and condition, moſt lamentable and fearefull, and yet wee can complaine of Idle boyes and ſluggiſh Schollers, that thinke they take to much learning for their money, and neuer conſider that we are the men, and that the prouerbe concerneth our ſelues. God will enter into iudgement with vs, and if we be not learners in his Schoole, he will remoue vs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge vs out of his Schoole. It had beene better for vs that we had neuer knowne God, that we had neuer receiued his truth; nay, it had beene better for vs that we had neuer beene borne, or beene borne Turkes and Canibals, Pagans and Infidels, then to haue the Goſpell among vs, and not to heare it; or to heare it, and not to learne by it: or to learne by it, and not to obey it
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7222:76" rendition="simple:additions"/> and grow daily in the practiſe of it. This appeareth by the greeuous threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings denounced by Chriſt our Sauiour againſt thoſe Citties where his word had beene preached and profeſſed, and his great miracles had beene wrought and ſhewed, <note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 11. 21. 22. 23. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Woe be to thee Corazin, woe be to thee Bethſaida, for if the great workes which were done in you: had beene done in Tyrus and Sidon, they had repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted long agone in ſackecloth and aſhes, but I ſay vnto you, it ſhall be eaſier for them at the day of iudgement then for you. And thou Capernaum which art lifted vp vnto Heauen, ſhalt be brought downe to Hell, for if the great workes which haue beene done in thee, had beene done among them of Sodome, they had remained to this day. But I ſay vnto you, that it ſhall be eaſier for them of the Land of Sodome in the day of iudgement; then for thee.</hi> He compareth heere <hi>Corazin</hi> and <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaida,</hi> with <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sydon:</hi> likewiſe <hi>Capernaum,</hi> with <hi>Sodom;</hi> that is, the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where Chriſt had dwelled, where the Goſpell had beene offered, where many of his miracles had beene manifeſted, with ſuch Citties as neuer had the Law, neuer heard the Goſpell, neuer ſaw the Prophets, neuer knew the Doctrine of ſaluation, but liued in ignorance and in idolatry. And in this compariſon he teacheth that ſuch Townes and Villages as haue had the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word, and the miniſtry of the Goſpell among them, ſhall receiue greater puniſhment in the day of iudgement then other poore blind wretches that neuer had theſe meanes offered vnto them. We would all of vs thinke it a very harſh and homely compariſon, and farre from all likely-hood of truth, if I ſhould compare vs, euen vs of <hi>Iſfield,</hi> with <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> wee know <note n="o" place="margin">Ezek. 16. 49.</note> how foule and filthy theſe places were, we confeſſe they are loathſome in our eyes, and odious in our eares, we know that for their wickedneſſe they <note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 19, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

No ſinne greater then the contempt of the Goſpel, as no mercy is greater then the peaceable enioying of the liberty of the Goſpell, and therefore no reward of ſinne ſhall be more horrible; So that we may truely ſay from the mouth of Chriſt, it ſhall be eaſier for Sodome in the day of iudgement, then for our Village. Let vs apply this to our ſelues, and lay it to our heartes to worke in vs true repentance. <hi>Corazin, Bethſaida,</hi> and <hi>Capernaum</hi> had many priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and might glory as much as we in the fauours vouchſafed vnto them, and yet they are vpbraided by Chriſt with their vnthanke-fulneſſe toward the Goſpell, ſo that the caſe of <hi>Sodome</hi> is made better. Take heed therefore leaſt we contemne the Goſpell, and ſo committing one of the greateſt ſinnes wee make our ſelues guilty of the greateſt iudgementes that can fal vpon mankind. The contempt of the Goſpell, hath brought the heauy hand of God vpon the Iewes that were Gods owne people. Let vs not be high minded, we are no whit better: but rather feare leaſt God ſpare not vs, and tremble vnder his grieuous, but yet righteous iudgements, who ſpareth not thoſe that are deere vnto him when they ſinne againſt him.</p>

It is a light vnto our feet and a lanthorne vnto our paths, it ſetteth vs in our way, and directeth vs vnto our iourneies end. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle teacheth, <note n="q" place="margin">1 Cor 3. 6.</note> that Paule planteth, Apollos watereth, but it is God that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the encreaſe; to wit, by the planting and watering of the Miniſters. The Husbandman tilleth and toyleth about his ground, he ſoweth his Corne, but he cannot make it ſpring vp, nor ſend the earely and latter raine. So is it with the Miniſters of the Goſpell, the Lordes Husbandmen, they muſt labour in
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7222:77"/> his field which is the Church, that the people may grow in faith and grace. This reproueth thoſe that attend not to the ordinance of God, with care and diligence, but neglect the worke of the Lord in them. They will not ſuffer themſelues to be ploughed and tilled, that grace may grow in their hearts, as Corne doth in the Fieldes. They ſay they increaſe and proceed in the waies of Godlineſſe, but they will not vſe the meanes which God hath ordained, and therefore they do deceiue themſelues. He that heareth not at all, doth not grow at all: he that heareth negligently, groweth ſlowly in any good thing. For as we ſow, ſo we ſhall reape. Againe, this checketh the dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and drowſineſſe of ſuch, as when they haue begun in the ſpirit, would end in the fleſh, which ſay the word is profitable and neceſſary to gather a Church, but not to continue it; to begin faith, but when it is begun and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in vs, we need not heare ſtill; we haue faith already by the preaching of the word; we ſhall not therefore need to frequent the preaching of it ſtill: we haue that wrought in vs which the word is appointed to worke. Theſe men vnder a colour of hauing faith, do ſcorne and deride the preaching of faith. But the word is not onely the immortall ſeed to beget vs, but whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome food to ſuſtaine vs: it is milke for ſuch as are weake, and ſtrong meate for ſuch as are of riper yeares. He neuer had faith by the word, that ſeeketh not the ſtrengthning of it by the word. It is not enough to haue ſaith, but we muſt ſeeke the encreaſe and continuance of it; which is continued &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued by the ſame meanes that it is bred and ingenderd. This it it which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth in his firſt Epiſtle, <note n="r" place="margin">1 Pet 1, 23. with Chap 2, 2</note> that being borne anew, not of mortall ſeed but of immortall, by the word of God, which liueth and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for euer, we ſhould as new borne babes deſire that ſincere milke, that we may grow thereby. Whereby we ſee, that he calleth the word immortall ſeed to regenerate vs, and ſincere milke to nouriſh vs, ſo that we haue as well our growing vp as our firſt birth by it, and there is a continuall vſe of the preaching of the word as well to men that are called aready, as to them that are to be called heereafter. For the end of preaching is, not onely to conuert vs, but to continue vs: not onely to raiſe vs vp, but to vphold vs: not onely to beget vs to the faith, but to ſtrengthen vs in the faith: not onely to giue the firſt life to vs, but to renew vs after our manifold ſlippes and often infirmities. We are euen in the ſtate of our regeneration as a ſhippe, which if it lye ſtill without vſe will rot in the Hauen, and if it be kept neuer ſo carefully, it will want rigging and repayring. So is it with euery one of vs in this life, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Phil 3, 12.</note> we haue not attained to perfection, we alwayes lacke ſomewhat, we ſtand in need of renewing and repairing, we muſt be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that which is impayred, encreaſing that which is leſſened, reſtoring that which is decayed, and keeping in his courſe that which is rightly orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>So then we muſt acknowledge a perpetuall neceſſity of the word, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in vs the graces of Faith and Sanctification, which without vſe of the meanes are ſubiect, if not to dying, yet to decreaſing; if not to periſhing, yet to diminiſhing; if not to withering away, yet to a languiſhing and looſing of thoſe degrees that haue beene begun in vs. Hence it is that the Lord ſaith, <note n="t" place="margin">Eſay 27, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>I the Lord doe keepe it,</hi> (that is, the Church which is the Vineyard of the Lord) <hi>I will water it euery moment, leaſt any aſſayle it, I will keepe it night and day.</hi> It is not with the Miniſters of the word as it is with men of other Trades, who when they haue begun a worke and are departed from it, though they returne not to it in a long time, yet they find it in the ſame caſe <note n="u" place="margin">

                  </note> as they left it. The Gold-ſmith that hath melted his ſiluer in the fire, and caſt a veſſell in the mould, &amp; begun to hammer it with his Tooles, if he lay it aſide at night, the next day when he commeth to his worke, he findeth it as he left it. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter that hath hewed his Timber, or the Maſon that hath ſquared his ſtones
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7222:77"/> in what ſort ſoeuer they left their worke when they departed from it, in the ſame they are ſure to ſee it, it is not better, it is not worſe, but as it lay, ſo it continueth. And thus it is in all other Sciences. It is not ſo in the Art of hearing and teaching, we do not alwaies find the people as we left them, we labour to haue them reformed and made zealous; yet they are no ſooner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, but the multitude of buſineſſe, the ſtrength of tentations, the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their nature, do ſo beſet them and beſiege them round about, whereby they are beguiled and enſnared, that they make the worke of reformation more hard and difficult then it was before. This made the Apoſtle Paule ſay of the Galathians, that he trauailed in birth againe with them vntill Chriſt were formed in them, and was affraid leaſt he had laboured among them in vaine, Gal. 4. 11. 19. This alſo made the Apoſtles conſent and agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to viſit the Churches where they had preached the Goſpell, <note n="x" place="margin">Acts 14. 22.</note> to confirme them in the truth which they had receiued. For as we eate often for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of the force of nature, and repairing of the decaies of the body: ſo it is our duty to heare often, for the making vp of the breaches and ruines that Sinne and Sathan haue made in our ſoules. We ſee by daily experience, that after our repentance &amp; the renewing of our mindes, we are ſubiect to ſtumble and fal into ſinne, and ready to lye long in it, as men caſt into a deep and dead ſleepe, if we be not awaked with the Trumpet of the Lord in our eares. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> was by the ſubtilty of the enemy ſurprized, <note n="y" place="margin">2 Sam 12, 7. 13.</note> and drawne to commit two horrible ſinnes, Adultery and murther, he lay a long ſpace ſecurely in them, vntill he was by the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> rouſed vp and recouered. Wherefore as there is a continuall vſe and exerciſe of repentance, ſo is there a continuall vſe of the preaching of the word, that we ſhould not ſtand at a ſtay, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe more and more, vntill we come to the fulneſſe of the perfect age of Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</p>

He is accounted an euill ſcholler that learneth not ſomewhat euery day, but many thouſands remaine in the ſchoole-houſe of Chriſt, that are ſo farre from profiting euery day, that they ſuffer whole weekes and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, and yeares to paſſe ouer their heads, without calling themſelues to an account what they haue learned that they knew not before, and wherein they yeeld obedience which they practiſed not before.

In this number are the greateſt ſort that liue among vs, they are ſtanders, and not walkers: they are ſitters, and not mouers; where you left them this yeare, you ſhall be ſure to find them the next yeare, and many yeares after. They ſee the time of their life, and the yeares of their age proceed and haſten vnto an end, yet they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer endeauour to proceed in Godlineſſe, and to haſten to Gods Kingdome: whereas we ſhould all prouide, that as the outward man decayeth, ſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner man may be renewed; and as the body is weakened, ſo the ſpirit may be ſtrengthened. Wherefore let all ſuch know, that not to go forward, is to go
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7222:78"/> backward: not to encreaſe, is to decreaſe: not to labour, is to loyter: not to go before, is to come behind; and not to proceed is not to profit, but to looſe all. Our Sauiour ſpeaking <note n="z" place="margin">Mat 25, 18, 26, 27, 28, 29.</note> of the ſeruant, to whom he had giuen one Talent that digged it in the earth, and hid his Maiſters money, ſaith: <hi>Thou euill ſeruant and ſlouthfull, thou kneweſt that I reape where I ſowed not, and gather where I ſtrewed not, thou oughteſt therfore to haue put my mony to the Exchangers, and then at my comming ſhould I haue receiued mine owne with aduantage: take therefore the Talent from him, and giue it vnto him which hath ten Talents: for vnto euery man that hath, it ſhall be giuen, and he ſhall haue abundance, and from him that hath not, euen that he hath ſhall be taken away.

So the Apoſtle reproueth the Hebrewes, becauſe <note n="a" place="margin">Heb 5, 12.</note> when as concerning the time they might be Teachers, yet they had need a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to be taught what are the firſt principles of the word of God, and were become ſuch as had need of milke and not of ſtrong meat. <note place="margin" type="runSum">The ſecond reproofe.</note> Secondly, it repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſuch as runne a while and then giue ouer, ſo that al their righteouſneſſe is as a morning dew.

The ſpirit of God is in many reſpectes reſembled to fire, which purgeth ſome things, conſumeth other things, and heateth other thinges. So doth the Spirit of God purge, conſume, and warme.

This is it which the Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> ſetteth downe, 1 Cor. 9, 19. <hi>Though I bee free from all Men, yet haue I made my ſelfe Seruant vnto all Men, that I may winne the more.</hi> Wee are brought into the World, to doo good to

                  <hi>We preach not our ſelues, but Chriſt Ieſus the Lord, and our ſelues your ſeruants for Ieſus ſake.</hi> If then, the Miniſters be the ſeruants of the Church, and all men Seruauntes one toward another; wee muſt in all thinges ſhew our ſelues Seruants, by ſeruing the neceſsities, and ſeeking the good of all our Bretheren amongſt whom we liue.</p>

Thus it ought to be among all the faithfull; if Chriſt Ieſus be our head, we muſt bee affected as mutuall members one to another. So the Apoſtle teacheth, that as the <note n="x" place="margin">1 Cor. 12, 12</note> bodie is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the bodie, which is one, though they be many, yet are but one bodie; euen ſo, is Chriſt.

There is none of vs but haue receiued ſome guift, and by the vſe thereof may do ſome good.

He hath giuen all his goods among vs all, hee hath not giuen all to euery one, but he hath beſtowed ſome to one, and ſome to another, in one meaſure to this man, in another meaſure to that man. But howſoeuer the number of our guifts bee ſmall, and the meaſure of them little, yet no man hath ſo ſmall a number, or ſo little a meaſure, but hee may gaine ſome glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to God the giuer of them, and doo ſome good to his Brethren by the vſe of them.</p>

We ſee this in the Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, who are made able and apt to teach, who are filled and furniſhed with gifts anſwereable to their calling, to do good in their places, when they grow ſloathfull, and ſpend their dayes without care and conſcience of their duties, they are infatuated of God, and abhorred of men, they run into groſſe errors, and are made ridiculous euen to children.

               <p>Theſe men through their benumming and back-ſliding, cauſe the name of God to be euill ſpoken of, raiſe a ſcandall vpon their profeſſion, bring an euil name vpon the word, and open the mouths of wretched men to ſpeak againſt true Religion, and all thoſe that do embrace it. True Religion is a woorthy worke, and a great building, it requireth harde labour, great patience, much ſtriuing, and long continuance, whereof our Sauiour Chriſt putteth vs in mind, when he ſaith, <note n="b" place="margin">Luke 14, 28. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>Which of you, minding to builde a Tower, ſitteth not down before, and counteth the cost, whether he haue ſufficient to performe it, leaſt that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath laide the foundation, and is not able to performe it, all that behold it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to mocke nim, ſaying; This man began to build, &amp; was not able to make an end.</hi> Wherefore, it ſtandeth all Paſtors &amp; people vpon, to remember from whence they are falne, and to do their firſt workes, leſt God come againſt them in his anger, and vex them in his fore diſpleaſure. The calling of the Miniſtery is an high calling; it is one of the higheſt callings; but if wee make it a calling of eaſe and ydleneſſe, feeding our ſelues, and not teaching the people, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace our office, and make it moſt vile with God and men. This is it which our Sauiour expreſſeth vnder the compariſon of Salt, when hee ſaith, <note n="c" place="margin">Luke 14, 35.</note> 
                  <hi>Salt is good, but if Salt haue loſt his ſauour wherwith ſhall it be ſalted?</hi> It is neither meet for the Land, not yet for the Dunghill, but men caſt it out.

So then, ſuch as are made Ouer-ſeers of others to teach the Church, and watch ouer the people of God, are reproued, being idle &amp; ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ſuch as will take no paines in inſtructing thoſe that are committed vnto them. Let Miniſtets be diligent and watchfull to doe the duties of their calling: let them preach the worde in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon; let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of ſluggiſhneſſe and ſlothfulneſſe. Al ſuch as are idle and negligent, are not worthy to be maintained, they vſurpe that hire which they receiue, they haue no right or interreſt to liue of the Goſpell, that doe not preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; they haue no iuſt title to eate the milke of the flocke, that do not feede the Sheepe, albeit they may claim their wages by the Lawes of men, yet they are no better in the account of the high God, then Theeues and robbers that liue by ruine and ſpoyle of the people, <note n="f" place="margin">Gal. 6. 6.</note> who are partakers of all their goods, and yet like wrongfull vſurpers, they wil not teach them in the word; yea the good ordinances of men require, that ſuch as receiue wages ſhould doo the worke, and ſuch as take the hire, ſhould take the paines.</p>
               <p>If any man haue an houſe to build, if he ſee the Carpenter and Maſon idle, and do nothing, ſo that the frame to bee ſet vp, is in no greater forwardneſſe in the end of the yeare, then it was in the beginning, will hee pay them their wages? Or if we haue any buſineſſe to do, will we pay the workemen before the worke be finiſhed, or if they let it alone and leaue it vndone? And ſhall it go worſe with the people of God, then all other that hire labourers to labor for them? Or ſhall they alone be conſtrained, to maintaine and ſuſtaine ydle Lubbers and loyterers that can do nothing, or will do nothing, more then a Child of ſeauen yeares old may do as well as themſelues? We are the Lordes Builders, and ſpirituall Maſons to build his Church; we are his husbandmen to Till his ground; we are Shepheards to feede his flocke. It is out dutie to frame his building, and euery day to adde ſomewhat to the building. It is our duty to Plough vp the fallow ground, and ſow the precious ſeed of the word among them, that they may grow thereby. It is our dutie to feed his Sheepe with wholeſome food, and to lead them into greene paſtures. If we bee not carefull to do our worke, there is no reaſon we ſhould receiue his wages; and if we care not to diſcharge the duty, we cannot with a good Conſcience take a penny: if we will be at no paines, what warrant haue we to make any gaines by our ydleneſſe. God hath prouided for vs a liberall allowance; hee requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of the people a cheereful performance thereof, and he chargeth the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to haue a carefull remembrance to labour in the Lordes harueſt, that ſo they may eate their owne bread, and not liue by the ſweate of other mens browes.

                  <hi>Euen when we were with you, this we warned you of, that if there were any which would not worke, that he ſhould not eate: for wee heare, that there are ſome which walke among you inordinately, and worke not at all, &amp;c.</hi> Let all ſuch therefore, as are negligent in the work of the Lord, and ſtand ydle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out employment, conſider, that as God hath giuen no guifts to be ydle, but to be vſed, ſo he would haue no ydle perſons to bee maintained, he doth grudge them their meate, he dooth not allow them a Morſell of bread, he regardeth not though they ſtarue, that will not ſet their handes to labour. For, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiteth and forbiddeth his Church and people, to beſtowe any thing vppon ſluggards, or to giue them any ſuccour, to the end, that the forcible weapon of neceſſity may conſtraine them to ſet their hand to worke, and alſo to buſie themſelues in the Calling which they profeſſe. And this ſtandeth with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great equitie, and good reaſon. For, what is meate, but the rewarde of Labour?

It were better that a mad man had no armour and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, then that he ſhould vſe, or rather abuſe them, to the death and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others: ſo it were better theſe men wanted theſe guiftes, then that they ſhould prophane them to the diſhonour of God, to the hurt of others, and to the bringing of a fearfull iudgement vpon their owne ſoules. It were better to do nothing, then to do euill; as we ſay, it is better to be ydle, then to be ill occupied. It were better to let the ſword reſt in the ſcabbard, then to drawe it out to wound the innocent; to let our riches corrupt, and our garments be moth-eaten, and our treaſure be cankred, then we weare them with pride, &amp; waſt them in drunkenneſſe, whoredome, and all wickedneſſe. We muſt one day giue an account vnto God, both what we haue receiued, and howe wee haue beſtowed that which we haue receiued. If the Marchant that hath had his Factor in a ſtrange Country, waſting his goods committed to him on har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, and in riotous liuing, will call him to an account how hee hath ſpent his time, and miſpent his goods; ſhall wee not thinke that the eternall God will ſummon vs before the barre of his iudgement ſeate, to giue in a reckoning &amp; an exact account what we haue done with ſuch guifts as he hath lent vs, and how we haue beſtowed them?</p>

It is an horrible ſinne to take away the preaching of Gods word from men. For whatſoeuer men pretend to excuſe their ſinne, and what Figge leaues ſoeuer they patch together to couer their ſhame, they are guilty of the deſtruction and damnation of ſo many ſoules, as by them might haue bin inſtructed. <hi>Iudas</hi> was guilty of an hainous ſinne for betraying and deliuering the body of one innocent to a temporall death: but theſe ſhall be arraigned of high treaſon againſt Ieſus Chriſt, who betray many thouſand ſoules into the hands of Satan, and throw them into the iawes of death, euen of eternall death. Such are the bloody Papiſts, which deny the vſe of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the people, and debarre them of the meanes of getting knowledge. And ſuch are all carnall Goſpellers, which thinke the preaching of the Goſpel, to be a needleſſe and ſuperfluous thing, and account the people to haue ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, ſo that they haue a praying Miniſtry alone, and the ſeruice read diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among them. Let vs therefore take heede, that we doo not ſtoppe the courſe of the Goſpell, or put out the light that would ſhine into our hearts, but rather further (with all our power) the trueth that God hath ſet vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, and ſpread abroad his ſauing health, that ſo glory may be gained to his name.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The fourth reproofe.</note> Laſtly, it reprooueth the neglect of employing the gifts of God beſtowed vpon them; that is, in the people. Whether God haue giuen vs ſpiritual gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or temporall bleſsings, we muſt take heede how we vſe them. We are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to heare, and willing to learne the faults of the Miniſters; yea, we can ſpeak of them our ſelues, and talke of them all day long; wee can tell that ſome vſe not their guifts to the good of the Church, others abuſe them to the hurt of the Church: but neuer conſider how themſelues employ their owne guifts, or what account they ſhall giue to God that hath beſtowed them. The benefite of them, is not in hauing of them, but in the vſing of them; not in the enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but in the employing; not in the poſſeſsing, but in the practiſing. Not to vſe them, is all one as if we had them not. For, as the couetous man wanteth as well the things that he hath, as thoſe which he hath not, ſo doo theſe ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards receiue the grace of God in vaine, which haue the vſe of thoſe thinges they enioy, no more then of thoſe things which they haue not obtained.

                  <hi>I will raiſe vp a Shepheard in the Land, which ſhall not looke for the thing that is loſt, nor ſeeke the tender Lambes, nor healt that that is hurt, nor feede that which ſtandeth vp, but he ſhall eate the fleſh of the fat, and teare the clawes in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> This alſo Chriſt our Sauiour teacheth in the Goſpell, <note n="h" place="margin">Math. 13, 12</note>

               <p>Furthermore, in the parable of the man, that going into a farre Countrey, called vnto him his ſeruants, and deliuered vnto them his goods; we ſee that the euil ſeruant, that hauing receiued a Talent hid it in the ground, &amp; brought

So are we vnfaithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, vniuſt Stewards, and euill beſtowers of our Maiſters mony, if we let it lye by vs, and do not imploy it to ſome gaine. If then they be blamed and vnrewarded that gaine nothing, what ſhall they be eſteemed, that looſe the Stocke, and daſh away the principall. Againe, if God haue giuen vnto vs this worldes good, he requireth of vs to do good with it, to helpe thoſe that are in want, and to diſtribute to the neceſſities of the Saintes.

It is a bleſſed thing when men haue endeuoured to their power to benefit others, to exhort them, to admoniſh them, to comfort them, to refreſh them, and haue vſed our guiftes to the profit of our bretheren.

The greateſt good is to ſeeke to gaine their ſoules; the next, is to giue to their bodies. On the other ſide, howe vncomfortable ſhall that day of our lepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be, how wofull and full of trouble, bringing horror of conſcience, vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirit, and confuſion of face: Woe then, woe (I ſay) to all idle Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and ſluggiſh people, that when they are to bee gathered vnto their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ly vpon their death beds, cannot remember what good they haue done, but ſhall bee troubled and tormented with the conſideration of this, what good they might haue done, that they might haue beene fruitfull trees, but haue beene barren; Good ground, but haue beene euill.

This is another end that we ought to reſpect in publiſhing the mercies of God to draw others to do the like, and to prouoke them as by an holy emulation of their godlineſſe. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle ſtirring vp the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to a bountifull helping of the Saints at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> he ſetteth before them the example of the Churches of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> that they ſhould follow them, <note n="i" place="margin">2 Cor. 8, 1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>We do you alſo, to wit Bretheren, of the grace of God beſtowed vpon the Churches of Macedonia, becauſe in great triall of affliction their ioy abounded, and their moſt extreame pouertie abounded vnto their rich libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.</hi> Hauing ſet before them this glaſſe to looke vpon, and in it to beholde themſelues, that albeit the <hi>Macedonians</hi> themſelues had heauie burdens laide vpon them, and many charges of their owne that preſſed them down, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were made poore, yea extreame poore, yet they hung not backe, but were forward according to their power, yea, beyond their power to ſuccour others.

                  <hi>That as they abounded in euerie thing, in faith, and word, and knowledge, and in all dilligence, and in their loue toward the Apoſtles, euen ſo they ſhould ſhew themſelues to abound in this grace alſo.</hi> Likewiſe hee commendeth the Theſſalonians, that they became followers of them, <note n="l" place="margin">1 Theſ. 1, 6. 7</note>

God is not aſhamed of vs, to bee called our God, and to do vs good; let vs not therefore be aſhamed to acknowledg him to be good vnto vs, and confeſſe his goodneſſe to the ſonnes of men. We ſee how men are not aſhamed to make knowne their vngodlineſſe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime it openly with brazen faces; they glorie in it as at a triumph, &amp; neuer bluſh at any thing. Let vs therefore be bold to ſpeake of good things, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it our dutie to ſound out alowd the graces that wee haue receiued.

This compelled and conſtrained him not to be ſilent in his owne cauſe, or rather in the cauſe of God and his Goſpell. For, albeit his enemies ſeemed onely to contemne him, and ſet his perſon at naught, yet the contempt reached farther, and thorough his ſides
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7222:84" rendition="simple:additions"/> they gaue a blow and a wound to the truth it ſelfe, we muſt not be ſo diſſolute and careleſſe to neglect what euery one ſpeaketh of vs, but be iealous of our credit and maintaine our good name, eſpecially when our ſincerity and Gods verity are ioyned together. We ſee how <hi>Samuell</hi> before all the people <note n="o" place="margin">1 Sam 12, 3.</note> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted his innocency in his life, and vprightneſſe in his calling, becauſe the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralites</hi> had reiected him and brought his miniſtry into queſtion. There was a a time when Chriſt would not haue himſelfe and his workes knowne; to wit, when the knowledge might hinder him and his preaching, but he <note n="p" place="margin">Mat 10, 27.</note> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Apoſtles to ſpeake that in the light which he had told them in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to preach that in the houſe toppes, which he told them in the eare. This ſerueth to condemne thoſe that derogate from the godly, and diminiſh the graces that God hath giuen vnto them, and beſtowed vpon them. For howſoeuer the notes of Godlineſſe are ſtamped vpon them, and the guiftes of God do ſhine as brightly as the light of the Sunne in them, whereby they are marked to be his, and knowne to belong vnto him, yet they wil leſſen and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate them and as it were clip the Princes Coyne, that ſo they may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced. This is a manifeſt note of a Child of the Deuill, and of repreſenting his Image. For as the names giuen to Sathan deſcribe his nature, ſo the word (Deuill) in the orriginall tongue which the holy Ghoſt vſeth, <note n="q" place="margin">Reuel 22, 10</note> ſignifieth a falſe accuſer, a carper, a cauiller, a diſgracer, a ſlanderer, one that by all means ſeeketh to deface the truth and thoſe that vphold and ſupport it. Thus the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our ſpirituall aduerſity is notably painted and purtraied out vnto vs. His whole practiſe ſtandeth in falſe accuſations, wrongfull imputations, and wilfull calumniations of God to man, and of man to God. He falſely accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to our firſt parents, in the beginning, <note n="r" place="margin">Gen 3, 5.</note> to enuy their good eſtate, and therefore of malice forbad them the Tree of the knowledge of good and euil. He falſely accuſed <hi>Iob</hi> to ſerue God; <note n="s" place="margin">Iob 1, 9, 10. 11.</note> in hipocriſie, not in ſincerity; with ſhew of the body, not with ſingleneſſe of heart; to be ſeene of men, not to approue himſelfe with an vpright conſcience in the preſence of God. Theſe quallities of the Deuill are to be found in all the wicked. If you talke and reaſon with them, of ſuch as truely feare God, either they will cenſure them as Hipocrits, and falſely accuſe them not to be the perſons which they make profeſſion to be, or elſe they will detract from them and diminiſh thoſe guiftes that God hath abundantly beſtowed vpon them. Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe could not eſcape this viperous brood, who was accuſed by the Deuils ofſpring, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of darkneſſe, the Scribes and Phariſies, to be a Samaritan, to haue a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, to be a Drunkard, to be a Seducer, a Blaſphemer, and what not? So was it with his Apoſtles, they were filled with the holy Ghoſt, and endued with the guiftes of tongues, yet they felt the ſmart of this rod, and were wounded with this ſharpe ſword, they were accounted Deceiuers, accuſed as Drunkards, ſlaunderd as Diſturbers of the common peace, and reuiled as Traitors, and Rebels againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> for the Diſciple muſt not looke to be <note n="t" place="margin">Iohn 15, 20.</note> aboue his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, nor the ſeruant greater then his Lord. Theſe reuilings and reproaches are not peculiar to Chriſt and his Apoſtles, but common to all the faithfull and true beleeuers in his name, they taſt of the ſame cup, and haue the like mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure meaſured vnto them. They are ſlandered and backbited, they are reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and taunted for the truthes ſake. But let all ſuch carpers and cauilers looke to themſelues and take heed to their eſtate, <note n="u" place="margin">Iohn 8, 44.</note> they reſemble their father whoſe workes they doe, and they ſhew themſelues to be petty-Sathans, and very Deuils incarnate. Now ſuch as are the Children of the Deuill, muſt look to haue their portion with the Deuill, and his Angels. Let vs therefore be ready to magnifie the mercies of God toward our bretheren; let vs ſpeake of the praiſes of him that hath giuen them; let vs remember what God hath done for vs and others; and eſpecially let vs beware that we do not diſgrace them and their guiftes, which tendeth to the diſhonour of him that gaue them.

For they lade them with the ſpoils of Chriſt, &amp; take from him the royalties of his Prieſt-hood, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore indeed they do not honor them, but diſhonor and diſgrace them, when they decke them with feathers that are not theirs.

It is their honor to honor the ſame God with vs, and to worſhip him. And it is our honoring of them, to giue all honor to God, by walking in thoſe wayes wherein they haue ledde vs the way, and by following the light which they haue carried before vs. And if we would know how to honour the Saints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and to giue them their due, <note n="z" place="margin" type="runSum">Wherein the honour of the Saints conſiſteth.</note> it conſiſteth in theſe pointes: Firſt, that God be magnified and praiſed in them: our praiſing of them muſt tend to the praiſing of him, who hath aduanced them, and crowned them with his gifts. God muſt be all in all to vs, and his glorie muſt be preferred and ſought for of vs. The Apoſtle remembring the Hiſtory of his owne calling and conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, telleth that the Churches of the Iewes ſaide, <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 1, 22, 23</note> 
                  <hi>Hee which perſecuted vs in times paſt, now preacheth the Faith which before hee deſtroyed; and they glorified God for me.</hi> When they heard he was gained to the Goſpell, they conſidered therein, the power, goodneſſe, and mercie of God, and with ioy of heart, they gaue him thankes for it. Secondly, the Saints ſhould be honoured by an approbation of Gods guiftes in them, and by an honourable mention of them. For, ſeeing they haue vſed the gifts of God faithfully, he wil haue their gifts praiſed and extolled, and the Saints themſelues to be magnified &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. So the Apoſtle mentioning his perſecuting of the church in the time of his ignorance, addeth, <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 15, 10</note> 
                  <hi>But by the grace of God I am that I am, and his grace which is in me, was not in vaine, but I laboured more aboundantly then they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which is with me.</hi> So in the Parable of the talents, they that vſed their talents well, &amp; increaſed much by the vſe of them, do heare this to their great praiſe, <note n="c" place="margin">Math. 25, 21</note>

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7222:85" rendition="simple:additions"/> and by an imitation of their vertues, being as examples and patternes for vs, to walke after. For this is the glorie of the Saints, if wee followe their Fayth, Hope, Charity, Patience, Doctrine, and other like graces that haue appeared in them.

Firſt of all, ſeeing Gods graces vpon others muſt worke ioy in our ſelues, we learn the truth of that article of our faith, which al profeſſe to beleeue, but many do not vnderſtand, to wit, the communion of Saints. There is a double commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <note n="m" place="margin">What the munion of Saints is, which we beleeue.</note> one which we haue with Chriſt; the other, which the church hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelues, &amp; the former is the cauſe of the latter. For Chriſt our head, hath giuen himſelfe vnto vs, whereby we haue the right of adoption, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of his righteouſneſſe, and a title to the kingdome of heauen. From hence, as from a fountaine, iſſueth that communion which all the members, both in heauen &amp; earth, haue among themſelues, howſoeuer ſeuered in place one from another, howſoeuer the one ſort be dead, the other liuing; &amp; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the one ſort is triumphant, the other Militant. Our Brethren in heauen wiſh well to the Church, pray for it generall, deſire the perfect conſummati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, and craue the full and finall deliuerance of it from all troubles. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle bringeth them in, ſpeaking on this maner, <note n="n" place="margin">Reuel 6, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>How long Lord, holy &amp; true! Doeſt not thou iudge and auenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth.</hi> True it is, they know not, they ſee not, they heare not what things are done vpon the face of the earth, and therefore they cannot pray in particular, for the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular conditions and perſons of men. On the other ſide, we who liue vppon the earth <note n="o" place="margin">Phil. 3, 20.</note> haue our conuerſation in heauen, our minds, our harts, &amp; ſoules, are there; we do in our deſires and affections conuerſe with them, we pray to be diſſolued, and to be with Chriſt. Our Communion among our ſelues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in three things; firſt, in the affection of the heart; ſecondly, in the gifts of the ſpirit; thirdly, in the vſe of temporall riches. The firſt in heart, when we are ſo linked and coupled together, that we are like affectioned one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that when one is greeued, the reſt are greeued; and when one reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, the reſt are refreſhed. The Euangeliſt deſcribing the eſtate of Chriſtes Church, ſaith, <note n="p" place="margin">Acts 4, 32.</note> 
                  <hi>The multitude of them that beleeued, were of one heart, and of one ſoule.</hi> The Heathen wiſh well to their owne blood and kindred, but wee muſt wiſh well to all Chriſtians, as to our ſelues; we muſt not onely know &amp; heare of, but feele their miſeries, and mourne with them that mourne; we muſt not tell them as newes, but lay them to our hearts. The ſecond branch is in the bleſsings of God beſtowed vpon vs, we muſt impart to our Brethren our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall gifts, we muſt teach them by our example, we muſt aduiſe them by our Counſell, we muſt guide them by our admonition, we muſt ſtirre them vp by our exhortation, we muſt raiſe them vp by our comforts, we muſt helpe them by our Prayers. The third part of our communion <note n="q" place="margin">Galat. 6. 10.</note> ſtandeth in temporal thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, when wee are content not onely to leaue our ſuperfluities, but euen to ſpend our ſelues for the good of our fellow-members; wee muſt be readie to feede the hungry, to cloath the naked, to harbour the harbourleſſe, which are not onely of our owne fleſh, but of our owne faith; not onely cloathed with the ſame Nature, but adorned with the ſame Name. This is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion which wee profeſſe and beleeue, and is confirmed and concluded in this place.</p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 2.</note> Secondly, we learn to deſire the beſt guifts, that we may reioyce and comfort the godly. For, when we profit in good things, we chear the harts and minds of al the faithful. Euery liuing thing hath his proſpering &amp; proceeding, and is known to haue life in it by encreaſing from one degree of perfection to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The graſſe ſpringeth, the plant ſhouteth, the corn floriſheth, the tree gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7222:87"/> If we haue any life in vs of Gods Spirit, &amp; be not as graſſe that is withered, as plants that are dead, as Corne that is blaſted, and as trees that are plucked vp by the roots, we muſt go forward from one meaſure of grace to another, from a leſſer to a greater. This ſerueth to reprooue ſundry abuſes, and to meet with many corruptions that abide and abound among vs. Firſt, it condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſuch as delight to offend, to grieue, and vexe the Saints of God. For, if we ſhould ſeeke to reioyce and comfort them, and to Miniſter all occaſion of ioy vnto them, then we are not to diſcomfort and trouble them, wee are not to worke ſorrow and anguiſh in them. The eſtate of theſe offenſiue liuers, is fearefull, as Chriſt our <note n="r" place="margin">Math. 18, 7.</note> Sauiour declareth. <hi>Woe vnto the world becauſe of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, for it muſt needs be that offences ſhall come, but woe be to that man by whom the offence commeth: whoſoeuer ſhall offend one of theſe little ones which beleeue in me, it were better for him, that a Milstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the Sea.</hi> Wee ought to giue no offence eyther to Iew or Gentile, or to the Church of God, for woe ſhall bee to them that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Brethren, that greeue the Spirit of God, and cauſe the enemies of our Faith to blaſpheme. Secondly, it reprooueth ſuch as conuerſe onely with the vngodly, and can be merry onely in their company. The Children of God haue alwayes accounted it a great croſſe and vexation to dwell with ſuch as are leud in their courſe of life, and are bare and barren in good things. The Prophet ſaith, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Pſal. 120, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Woe is me that I remaine in Meſhech, and dwell in the Tents of Kedar.</hi> It is an heape of miſeries, and a verie repreſentation of Hell, to be continually vexed, and exceedingly greeued with their wicked conuerſation. Iuſt <hi>Lot</hi> was vexed with the <note n="t" place="margin">2 Pet. 2, 7, 8.</note> vncleane conuerſation of the wicked; for hee being righteous and dwelling among them, in hearing and ſeeing, vexed his righteous ſoule from day to day with their vnlawfull deedes. And in what place almoſt now can a man liue, where all kinde of vile and vicious dealing is not practiſed, where all vncleanneſſe of life is not vſed? There is great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the ſociety of the faithfull, and not only great comfort, but great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. The Wiſeman teacheth, <note n="u" place="margin">Prou. 13, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>That he which walketh with the wiſe, ſhall bee wiſe, but a Companion of fooles ſhall be worſe.</hi> On the other ſide, the company of the wicked is accompanied with danger. It is a preſumption of our own ſtrength, to thruſt our ſelues among wicked companions. Such as are continually in the Sun, muſt needs be Sun-burnt. Such as walke in the miſt, muſt needes bee berayed: ſuch as touch pitch, cannot but be defiled: ſo, ſuch as abide in bad company, liue in places of danger, by reaſon of the infection of ſinne, of the weakeneſſe of the fleſh, of the forſaking of God, and of the power and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that Sathan hath in ſuch places where he ſetteth vp his Throne. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſinne is practiſed, defended, and maintained, where it couereth the earth as water doth the Sea, there the Deuill <note n="x" place="margin">Reuel. 2, 13.</note> raigneth; there he keepeth his court, there hee hath his reſidence &amp; remaineth, there he poſſeſſeth al things. So long therefore, as we keepe company with thoſe that commit ſinne with greedineſſe, and runne on in their euill courſes without controulement, wee ſhall be ſure to learne their wayes, and are in daunger to receiue deſtruction to our ſoules.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it reprooueth thoſe that go backeward in their profeſsion, that are corrupt trees and without fruite, twice dead and plucked vp by the roots. Where ſhall we in theſe daies find matter of ioy to comfort our ſelues, when godlineſſe ſo much decayeth, and wickedneſſe is ſet aloft? The Apoſtle ſayth notably to the Corinthians, <note n="y" place="margin">2 Cor. 2, 31.</note> 
                  <hi>I feare leaſt when I come againe, my God abaſe me among you, and I ſhal bewaile many of them which haue ſinned alreadie, and haue not repented of the vncleanneſſe, &amp; fornication, &amp; wantonnes which they haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</hi> Suffer me a little to paint out vnto you in his colours, the vnclean le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie, and filthy morphew, that hath by ſprading ſo diſfigured the face of this world, as it is made odious in the eyes and iudgments of al that haue any light
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7222:87"/> of Gods ſpirit to diſcerne it. If we conſider the times wherein we liue, wee may truely ſay, they are the perilous ſeaſons <note n="y" place="margin">Luk 18. 8. 1 Tim 3, 1, 2.</note> foreſhewed by Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, when faith is ſcarce found vpon the earth. What can we heare or ſee in any company to which we reſort, and not be either greeued, or guilty? For when we behold iniquity practiſed without feare, &amp; maintained without ſhame, if we be not greeued at the committing of it, we are made guilty of it. If all Recordes were ſearched from the beginning, and a narrow vew of other times taken, it would be found by experience (our helpes and meanes greater then theirs conſidered) that we ouermatch them all, in all kind of prophaneſſe and abominations. As forſwearing, lying, whoring, pride, Atheiſme, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe, looſeneſſe, vnmercifulneſſe, oppreſſion, coueteouſneſſe, ſacriledge, luxury, drunkenneſſe, enuy, Hipocriſie, malice, contempt of the word, and ſuch like, they haue ouerſpread the whole world as a running ſoare, as a fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Canker, and as a loathſome vlcer, whereby our age is become as the dregs and lees of all that haue gone before vs; yea, as a common ſinke that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth all filthineſſe and corruption into it. If any obiect, there was neuer more light of knowledge then is in our daies, and that the word was neuer ſo plainely and plentifully preached. I anſwere, if it be granted that the light of knowledge is wonderfull great, yet it is alſo as true that there was neuer more darkneſſe of impiety, neuer moe miſtes of vngodlineſſe, then now remain among vs; ſo that it ſeemeth our greatneſſe of knowledge, ſerueth to no other purpoſe, then to add to the greatneſſe of our condemnation. We are growne worſe then our predecſſors and forefathers, becauſe if there had not been ſuch light, there could not be ſuch darkneſſe. If we had beene blind and not ſeen the light, we ſhould not haue ſo greatly ſinned. Thus our Sauiour ſpeaketh to ſome of the Phariſies, <note n="z" place="margin">Ioh 9, 41,</note> 
                  <hi>If ye were blind, ye ſhould not haue ſinne, but now ye ſay, we ſee, therefore your ſinne remaineth.</hi> The Sunne of the Goſpell, hauing ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpon our mariſh groundes, hath raiſed theſe ſtenches, and giuen li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

For where the Goſpell doth not ſoften, it hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; where it worketh not conuerſion, it worketh confuſion; where it effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no good, it maketh men worſe, yea, worſe then <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> worſe then <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorah.</hi> Thus truth compelleth me, and wofull experience conſtraineth me, to be a witneſſe of that I would not if I could otherwiſe chuſe touching the common corruption and iniquity of our age. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> But ſome man may ſay, the goodneſſe of our profeſſors will make amends; and heale this ſoare; yea, make a full recompence of the former diſorders and abuſes. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I acknowledge with all thankfulneſſe and reioyſing, that God hath his Church, and choſen flocke among vs, contrary to the opinion and practiſe of ſuch as haue made a rent and ſeparation from vs. But although we haue a true Church of Chriſt with vs, it is a little flocke, a ſmall remnant, a gathering after the Harueſt, a gleaning after the vintage. It is an hard matter to finde a true <hi>Iſralite</hi> in whoſe heart is no guile. They are rare handes that are free from the contagions of the times, and pure from the ſpots of filthineſſe now raigning. We may take vp the complaint of the Prophet, <note n="a" place="margin">Mica 7, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>The beſt of them is a briar, and the moſt righteous of them ts ſharper then a Thorny heage.</hi> A man would haue thought, he might haue ingaged his life, and pawned his ſoule for the ſincerity of ſome, whom now we may behold to be gone as farre as <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> was, in the loue of this world. Their loue to the Saintes, their zeale to the word, their affection to the Miniſters, ſeemed to be ſuch, that no man doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but their names were written in the booke of life; who now ſeeme to be raſed out of that booke which God hath written. They indured the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Croſſe, they deſpiſed the ſhame of the world, they ſuffered the taunts of the wicked, who now are ſet downe in the ſeate of the ſcornefull, and are become luke-warme in their profeſſion. Selfe-loue hath quenched brotherly loue, mercy is ſwallowed vp through hardneſſe of heart, compaſſion
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7222:88"/> is turned into ſenceleſneſſe, yea all ciuill and iuſt dealing ſeeme to haue taken their Winges and to be fled vp into heauen, or elſe to be ſunke downe into the Center of the earth, and to haue left the ſociety of our new Chriſtians. It is now accounted a raſhneſſe, an heat of youth; yea, a ſinne worthy of ſharpe puniſhment, to ſtand to the rule and line of the word. If a man giue but a looke toward the Goſpell, and do not profeſſe himſelfe an open enemy vnto it: if he ſhew the leaſt entertainment to the truth, and do not ſet himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the profeſſors of it, though he be a common Gameſter, a rioteous liuer, an vſurer, an incrocher, and oppreſſor; he hath the name and title of a good Chriſtian, he hath the praiſe and commendation of a good profeſſor. What ioy therefore can the Children of God haue in ſuch workes of darkneſſe, and in ſuch workers of iniquity. We may wiſh with the Prophet, <note n="b" place="margin">Ier 9, 1.</note> that our head were full of water, and our eyes a Fountaine of teares, to weepe day and night for the deſolation and deſtruction that hangeth ouer their heads.

If we greeue through the wickedneſſe of our waies, and prophaneneſſe of our liues the Children of God; we likewiſe greeue the ſpirit of God, and quench ſuch good motions as are inſpired into vs.</p>

This duty hath many branches growing from it. For ſeeing Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces beſtowed, giue occaſion of great ioy, it ought to teach vs to exhort one an other, to comfort them that are comfortleſſe, to reproue them that goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray, to pray for our bretheren, to ſeeke to gaine and winne them to the faith; and when they are gained and wonne, to reioyce vnfainedly at their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and if we ſee any hope of their repentance and turning to God, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe with them and not to be aſhamed of their company. Certainly, he is not truely conuerted himſelfe, that doth not reioyce at the conuerſion of others. He neuer knew what true repentance meaneth, that conceiueth no ioy at the repentance of others.

                  <hi>Ionah,</hi> when he had preached to the <hi>Niniuites,</hi> and ſaw the great mercy of God in ſparing of them, and not deſtroying them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to hls preaching, and their deſeruinges, was angry, and it diſpleaſed him exceedingly. He regarded his owne credit and eſtimation among men, more then their conuerſion and preſeruation. This was in the elder Brother of the riotous and prodigall Sonne, <note n="g" place="margin">Luke 15, 31</note> when he ſaw the ioy of his Father, at the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of his Childe, and his readineſſe to forgiue, he was angry and would not go in. But his Father perſwadeth him, that there is no cauſe why he ſhould be grieued, inaſmuch as he is not himſelfe hindered or indamaged by this recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of his Brother into fauour; and reproueth him, in that hauing no regard of his brother, he is ſorry for the common ioy conceiued of his returne. That ioy did offend him, whereof he ſhould haue bin a Companion. Theſe two Reaſons are to be noted and obſerued, to root vp all enuy and malice out of our hearts, conſidering that we looſe nothing, whenſoeuer God doth graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly receiue into fauour, thoſe which through ſinne were falne from him, &amp; that it is haughtineſſe without godlineſſe; greefe without mercy; and cruelty without compaſsion; not to reioyce and be glad, when we ſee any of our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſeruants reſtored from death to life, raiſed from ſinne to righteouſneſſe; and found, who before were loſt. He then is vnrighteous and vngodly, who enuyeth his brother receiued into fauour, and he doth peruerſely and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, which doth murmure at the mercy of God vpon our brethren. <note place="margin" type="runSum">The fourth reproofe.</note> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it condemneth ſuch as faile in the former duty, that neuer exhort their brethren to godlineſſe, neuer diſſwade them from ſinne, neuer comfort thoſe that are in miſery, neuer praying for them that are in diſtreſſe, neuer deſire God to be good vnto them, neuer reioyce with them, when God hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mercie.</p>
               <p>We liue in theſe times, when the hand of God is ſtretched out againſt many of our brethren, they are reſtrained and ſhut vp by the contagion of plague &amp; peſtilence.

If all were rich, and abounded in outward wealth, we ſhould neither know God, nor our ſelues, nor our Brethren: we would be ready to ſay, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Prou. 30, 9.</note>

If all were poore, and in neceſsity, there would be nothing but robbing, ſtealing, periury, and all confuſion. Wherefore, it is the ordinance of God, that ſome ſhould be rich, and ſome poore, ſome wealthy, and others in want. Hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſome poore, to exerciſe their patience, and to try howe they will beare that burden, and behaue themſelues vnder the croſſe.

Firſt, this being ſo neceſſary a duty required of all men, it teacheth a difference betweene the Heathen and Chriſtian religion. The Heatheniſh Religion neuer tooke order for the poore, nor required any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion toward them; but the profeſſion of Chriſt, chargeth this duty vpon all true beleeuers, and teacheth that iudgement ſhalbe without mercy, to thoſe that ſhew not mercy. When <hi>Paule</hi> departed from the reſt of the Apoſtles at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> they <note n="t" place="margin">Gala. 2, 10.</note> warned him onely that he ſhould remember the poore, which thing alſo he was diligent to doe. But this was neuer remembred, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, nor intended among the Nations that were vnbeleeuers. True it is, the Painims and Philoſophers, haue held and deliuered many morrall inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſpoken well of Iuſtice, Temperance, Clemency, Prudence, and Friendſhip, of obedience toward parents, of Gentleneſſe toward men, of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality toward the poore, of loue toward our Country, of Loialty toward Princes, and ſuch other vertues. He that ſhould deny <note n="u" place="margin">
                     <hi>Antimachia. preface before the ſecond booke</hi>
                  </note> their precepts in part to be wel ſpoken, and in part to be wel practiſed, ſhould do them great wrong. But the Chriſtian Religion, as it hath all theſe in common with them, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and allowing of them; yea, not diſdaining to read their bookes and to learne ſuch Doctrine of them as they haue left in writing, ſo it hath lanched out a great deale deeper, and entred farther, and conſidered better of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of good life, and the practiſe of good manners, then the Heathen and Infidels haue done. It was a rule of one of the wiſeſt among the Gentiles, <note n="x" place="margin">Plato.</note> that we are not borne onely for our ſelues, but that our birth is partly for our Country, partly for our Parents, and partly for our friendes. A goodly and Golden ſentence much admired, and greatly commended, and oftentimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged. But if it be compared with the Doctrine of Chriſt, and the duty of all Chriſtians, it will be found maimed in his limmes, and defectiue in his parts, neither hauing a good beginning, nor making a perfect ending. For firſt of all, he preſcribeth that our Charity ſhould be imployed toward our ſelues, which they haue well marked, allowed, and followed, which ſay, that a well ordered Charity beginneth at himſelfe. But this is farre from the Doctrine of Chiſt and his Apoſtles. Chriſt himſelfe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth vs <note n="y" place="margin">Mat 22, 39.</note> to loue our Neigh-as our ſelues, and <hi>Paule</hi> teacheth <note n="z" place="margin">1 Cor 13, 5.</note> that Charity ſeeketh not her owne things. Againe, he maketh mention of our Country, of our parents, and of our friends, and rangeth them into good order, but what becommeth of the poore? where or in what place of this notable ſentence doth he place them? he ſpeaketh not of them at all, let them ſhift as they can, they are quite forgotten, the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers Charity ſtretcheth not to them; let them ſinke or ſwimme, liue or die, feed or ſtarue, it was all one to him and to that Religion that he beleeued. And indeed a poore perſon in the time of the Painims had no other meanes to liue and ſuſtaine himſelfe and his family, then to ſell himſelfe as a ſlaue to him that would buy him, if no man were found that would buy him, he periſhed for hunger, and died through want and famine. True it is, when they ſaw ſome men with their eyes languiſhing in miſery, and heard them with their eares pitifully complaining in their extremity, they were ſometimes touched with commiſeration and compaſſion toward poore perſons, but they neuer called or accounted this duty of humanity a vertue, but onely an humane paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or naturall affection. Furthermore, they neuer builded or erected any Hoſpitalls or houſes of refreſhing to lodge and nouriſh the poore, neither had the Princes their Almoners, to diſtribute their Almes as Chriſtians haue. When a Child was borne miſhapen and euill-formed among them, it was killed; <note n="a" place="margin">

               <p>Thus we ſee what the Religion of theſe Panims and Miſcreants was, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, beaſtly, bloody, defiled with all cruelty, contrary to al pitty and piety, regarding the poor no more then brute beaſts, and making no more account of them, but for their ſeruice they drew from them, and for the want they had of them. For among all the morral precepts which they taught and deliuered, we neuer read that they ſpake any thing, that they preſcribed or perſwaded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing touching the poore, nor that they euer eſtabliſhed any good pollicy to helpe them.

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The order of the words.</note> IN the words going before, wee haue heard the preface or entrance of this Epiſtle, conſiſting partly in the Title of it, and partly in certaine Prayers v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Apoſtle: Now we are to proceed to the reſt of the Epiſtle, wherein we muſt obſerue two points; Firſt, the cheefe matter is handled; Secondly, the whole matter is concluded. The cheefe matter, is touching <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> or himſelfe. The firſt, concerning <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> is handled from the eight verſe, to the 22. verſe. The latter touching himſelfe, is expreſſed in the 22. Verſe, wherein he willeth to prepare lodging for him, hoping by their Prayers to be deliuered out of priſon. The former point is ſet downe in this ſhort ſpeech or ſentence, <hi>I Paule pray thet to receiue Oneſimus:</hi> The parts of which ſentence are not barely propounded, but amplified; and then, the whole is prooued &amp; confirmed. We are therein to conſider three partes; Firſt, the intreating and praying of <hi>Philemon;</hi> Secondly, the perſon praying and intreating; Thirdly, the perſon for whom he prayeth and intreateth. His praying of <hi>Philemon,</hi> is declared by a diuers reaſon, <hi>Although I haue great libertie to command thee, yet I pray thee and beſeech thee.</hi> The perſon praying and beſeeching, is <hi>Paule,</hi> who is deſcribed generally, being ſuch a one, and then particularly by his old age, and by his bonds. Touching the perſon, for whom hee beggeth and beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, we ſhall ſee afterward, Verſe 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The meaning of the words.</note> This is to be obſerued touching the order of the words. Now, let vs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the interpretation of them. Firſt, he ſpeaketh of his liberty in Chriſt, that is; as an Apoſtle and Miniſter of Chriſt, whoſe Meſſenger or Ambaſſador he is; whereby he inſinuateth and ſignifieth, that this power is not his owne, or of himſelf, but is Chriſts; it is not the ſeruants, but the Lords; it is not mans, or the Miniſters, but Gods. For euen at Magiſtrates ordained and ſent foorth by the Prince, can do nothing in their owne name, but in the Kings name; ſo Miniſters called of God, and fitted to the office wherunto they are called, muſt teach, command, reprooue, and exhort, not in their owne name, but in the name of Chriſt their Lord and Maiſter. He addeth, <hi>That for loues ſake he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth him.</hi> Loue, in this place, may bee referred either to <hi>Philemon,</hi> or to <hi>Paule,</hi> ſeeing the Apoſtle leaueth it at large, and reſtraineth it not either to his loue, or to his owne. If it be referred to <hi>Philemon,</hi> it carieth this ſence, I do intreat thee, and not command thee, for thy compaſſion and loues ſake, which I haue before commended in thee, and thou ſo diligently and deuoutly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt vnto the Saints. But I do not take this to bee the naturall meaning of the words, ſo that we are to vnderſtand them rather of <hi>Paules</hi> loue toward <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> that he ſo tendered and loued him, as that he had rather deale with him in kindneſſe, and by intreatance, then roughly and ſeuerely. Laſtly, he ſayth, <hi>Paule, an Old man, and now a priſoner of Chriſt.</hi> In theſe wordes, is included great force to moue <hi>Philemon:</hi> Wee muſt vnderſtand the firſt Wordes of his Age, not of his Office; of his yeares, not of his Miniſtery; and hee calleth himſelfe a priſoner of Chriſt, that is; for Chriſts ſake, and the preaching of his Goſpell.</p>
               <p>So then, according to this Interpretation, theſe wordes are thus much in effect, as if hee had ſayde; Seeing I heare euerie where of thy feruent Loue, and exceeding tender Compaſsion thou beareſt to the poore Saintes, though I may manie wayes commaund thee in thinges that are right and equall, as in that I am an Apoſtle of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, in that I am ſtricken in Age, readie to leaue this life, and in that I am nowe a Captiue and Priſoner,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7222:93"/> for the cauſe of Chriſt and his Goſpell, yet the loue and tender affection I beare vnto thee, do moue me rather to beſeech and to intreat thee.</p>
               <p>Now let vs ſee what may be obſerued out of theſe wordes. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obſeruations out of theſe wordes.</note> Firſt of all, the Apoſtle would not do that which he might doe, and was lawfull for him to doe, which may teach the Miniſter and all men ſometimes to be content to depart from their right, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did toward <hi>Lot,</hi> when a ſtrife aroſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, <note n="h" place="margin">1 Cor 9, 4.</note> and as <hi>Paule</hi> did oftentimes, according as himſelfe teſtifyeth in his Epiſtles. Which condemneth thoſe that ſtand ſtrictly vpon their right, <note n="i" place="margin">1 Cor 10.</note> and conſider what is lawfull but forget what is fit and expedient. For in thinges that are indifferent we are not by and by allowed to do that which is lawfull, <note n="k" place="margin">1 Cor 9, 12, 15.</note> nor to vſe our power, but muſt ſuffer all thinges, that the Goſpell of Chriſt be not hindred. Likewiſe, the Apoſtle would not ſometimes take any wages of the Church, but preached freely and was not chargeable to any, becauſe he would not giue occaſion of ſpeaking euil againſt the Goſpell. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Apoſtle publiſheth his liberty to command, but it is onely in Chriſt whoſe Miniſters he and we are, and not our owne. Thus he calleth himſelfe an Apoſtle, <note n="l" place="margin">Galtath. 1, 1.</note> not by man, nor by the will of man, but of Chriſt. This is the difference betweene a ciuill Magiſtrate, and an Eccleſiaſticall Miniſter. The ciuill Magiſtrate may giue charge and ſend out commandements in his owne name, but the Miniſter muſt command in his Maſters name, in aſmuch as Chriſt hath not imparted the power, nor communicated the right which he hath ouer mens conſciences vnto any mortall man, no not to the Angels in Heauen. Wherefore, whatſoeuer we ſpeake or do, we muſt do all in his name that hath ſent vs. Thirdly, marke how farre his authority ſtretcheth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth, he can require and exact no more then that which is right and equall and their duty to doe. It is no abſolute or immoderate power, but limitted within theſe boundes, that he goe not beyond them. This is required of all the Miniſters of the word, they are to teach that which is right, and he peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are bound no farther to heare them. Fourthly, he declareth why he yeelded vp a part of his right and did not proſecute it to the full, for loue ſake, it was for Charity ſake that he turned his power into prayer. All indifferent thinges muſt be meaſured by this rule. Charity will cauſe a man willingly to giue place where it is in the heart, but where it is not, he will not regard to vſe his liberty with offence, nay to the deſtruction of his brother. 5 Laſtly, <hi>Paule</hi> to moue <hi>Philemon</hi> propoundeth his bandes and afflictions, to teach that no man ought to greeue at the afflictions of the Church. We ought to be ſo farre from being aſhamed <note n="m" place="margin">2 Tim. 1, 8. Epheſ. 3, 13.</note> of the Croſſe in our ſelues, and from being offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the Croſſe in others, that rather we are to know, it commendeth the Miniſtry, and ſerueth greatly to edification. For by this title he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth himſelfe, and purchaſeth authority vnto his Miniſtry, whereby he ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth not onely that he is an Apoſtle, but ſomewhat more; an Apoſtle, a priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; that is, adorned with the markes and tokens of Apoſtolicall honour, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the badges of the Apoſtleſhip are ſuch bandes as he ſuffered for Chriſts ſake. So then, a Miniſter afflicted, is more then a Miniſter: a Chriſtian per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, is more then a Chriſtian: and euery faithfull man and woman, the more they are tried by ſuffering for the Goſpell, the more they are to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and the better to be eſteemed in the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">[<hi>I haue great liberty in Chriſt, to command thee.</hi>]</q> The Apoſtle hauing to deale with <hi>Philemon,</hi> whom he had wonne by his Miniſtry to the Goſpell, and whom he had authority to command in the Lord; ſaith, that he might be bould to vrge and preſſe him to this duty in regard of the Office of Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, of the greatneſſe of his age, and of the ſufferings of bonds and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. The Office of the Paſtor, is an Office of power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</note> Heereby we learne, that the Paſtor by his Office hath power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to require and to command men as the Miniſter of Chriſt to do their duties. The Teachers of the Church haue power by their calling and place

We ſee then, that the Miniſtry is an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of power, and the Miniſters muſt haue boldneſſe in the diſcharge of their duty, and in the execution of their calling. This we ſee in the practiſe of the Prophets of God, and of the Apoſtles of Ieſus Chriſt. When <hi>Eliah</hi> was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by <hi>Ahab</hi> to be a troubler of Iſrael, he anſwered with freedome of ſpeech, and boldneſſe of ſpirit, and vehemency of zeale, <note n="n" place="margin">1 Kin. 18, 18</note>

               </p>
               <p>This Doctrine among other places hath moſt plentifull confirmation out of the propheſie of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> whether we conſider the commandement of God, or the practiſe of the Prophet. Heerunto commeth that which the lord ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to him, <note n="p" place="margin">Ier. 10, 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold, this day I ſet thee ouer the Nations, and ouer the kingdoms, to plucke vp, and to roote out, to deſtroy and throw downe, to build and to plant.</hi> When <hi>Paſhur</hi> had ſmitten him, and put him in the ſtockes, <note n="q" place="margin">Ier. 20, 4.</note> the Prophet ſayde vnto him, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, behold, I will make thee to be a terror to thy ſelfe, and to all thy friends, and they ſhall fall by the ſworde of their enemies, and thine eyes ſhall behold it, &amp;c.</hi> This authority the Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> doth often claime &amp; challenge vnto himſelfe ouer the people, and he ſheweth what power he had by reaſon of his Miniſtry. When hee giueth ſundry inſtructions to diuers degrees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he ſaith, <note n="r" place="margin">1 Cor. 7, 10.</note>

                  <hi>Seeing then that we haue ſuch truſt, wee vſe great boldneſſe of ſpeech.</hi> It is noted by the Euangeliſt, <note n="t" place="margin">Math. 7, 29.</note> that Chriſt taught as one ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing authority, and not as the Scribes, that is; boldly, not fearefully; zealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly, not coldly; with great power, not as one that telleth a dreame. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle writing to <hi>Timothy,</hi> doth not onely gently intreat him, but ſtraightly charge him <note n="u" place="margin">1 Tim. 5, 21. and 6, 13.</note> before God and the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and the elect Angelles, that he obſerue thoſe things, without preferring one to another, and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing partially.

They are <note n="y" place="margin">1 Cor. 4, 15.</note> Fathers in Chriſt, but Parents may be bolde with their children.

They are <note n="b" place="margin">Hebr. 13, 7.</note> Captains of the Lords hoaſt, but the Captaine hath rule and gouernement ouer thoſe that are vnder his charge and regiment. If then the true Miniſters of Chriſt be Fathers, Shepheards, Ambaſſadors, and Captains vnder Chriſt the great ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of the Sheepe, their Office cannot be without iuriſdiction and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ouer the people of God committed to their charge.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 2.</note> Secondly, if we conſider the fruits and effects that are aſcribed in the word to the Miniſters of the word, we ſhall ſee that their Miniſtry is ioyned with authority. They are the meanes and inſtruments to bring vs to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt, to the boſome of the Church, and to the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Their Office is to conuert ſinners, and to ſaue ſoules. When Chriſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended vp into Heauen, he appointed Paſtors and Teachers in his Church <note n="c" place="margin">Ephe 4, 11, 12.</note> for the repairing of the Saintes; for the worke of the Miniſtry, and for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the body of Chriſt, till we all meet together (in the vnity of faith and that acknowledging of the ſonne of God) vnto a perfect man, and vnto the meaſure of the age of the fulneſſe of Chriſt. So the Apoſtle exhorteth <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> to take heed to himſelfe, to exerciſe his guifts, to giue attendance to Reading, to be diligent in exhortation, and to continue in deliuering ſound Doctrine, <note n="d" place="margin">1 Tim 4, 16.</note> becauſe in dooing theſe thinges he ſhould ſaue both himſelfe and them that heare him. God hath put into them and their mouths the word of reconciliation, ſo that faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word of God, and therefore the Miniſters are ſaid to ſaue their owne ſoules, and the ſoules of others.</p>

                  </gap>peration of God and the Miniſters Office together, and an admirable ſimpathy betweene them. If then God and the Miniſter do worke together, he may lawfully inioyne men to do their duties. This is it which the Apoſtle teacheth, <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor 3, 9. and 2 Cor, 6, 1</note> 
                  <hi>We are together Gods labourers,</hi> and in another place, <hi>We therefore as workers together, beſeech you that ye receiue not the grace of God in vaine,</hi> where to comfort the Miniſters againſt the contempt of the world, he declareth, that it pleaſeth God to vſe their Miniſtry to worke faith in whom he will. True it is, the Miniſters are not able to giue or worke faith in the hearers, either in whole or in part, it is God onely that giueth encreaſe and a bleſſing vpon his owne meanes, but they are the inſtruments which he imployeth. He commandeth the Miniſters to preach, and he giueth a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to their preaching. The Miniſter laboureth on the heart and conſcience God reformeth it, and giueth the grace of repentance. The Miniſter deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Doctrine of faith, God giueth the gift of faith. The Miniſter teacheth righteouſneſſe and holineſſe of life, God ſaith; be it ſo, he ſhalbe righteous and holy. The Miniſter pronounceth mercy to the penitent, God beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mercy and forgiueneſſe of ſinnes vpon him. Thus God ratifieth their word, and after a ſort tieth his bleſſing vnto it. Seeing rherefore, that the Miniſters of the word haue many titles of power and iuriſdiction giuen vnto them, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are the meanes and inſtruments appointed to bring vs to ſaluation, and Laſtly, ſeeing they worke with God and as it were helpe him in bringing men to faith and eternall life; we may conclude, that their Office is ioyned with power and authority.</p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</note> Let vs ſee what are the vſes of this Doctrine. Firſt, touching the Office it ſelfe, we gather, that it is a worthy calling, an honourable Office, an excellent Function, how baſe and meane ſoeuer it be eſteemed among men of this world. This the Apoſtle ſetteth downe writing to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">1 Tim 3, 1.</note> 
                  <hi>If a man deſire the Office of a Biſhop, that is, a Miniſter of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e Goſpell, he deſireth a worthy worke,</hi> not onely a worke, but a worthy worke. Therefore this Office, is not onely a lawfull calling; but a worthy calling. It is hard to diſcharge it aright, for who <note n="g" place="margin">2 Cor 2, 16.</note> is ſufficient for theſe thinges? but thoſe thinges that are hard, are excellent. The Minſter beareth the perſon of Chriſt in preaching the word and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the Sacraments. We heard before that in furthering and finiſhing the ſaluation of men, God worketh with them. It is a great and glorious account which God maketh of his word in the mouth of his Miniſters, when it is true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preached and rightly applied, he giueth grace by it, and ordinarily worketh not ſaluation without it. This is no ſmall honour and eſtimation to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of God, and to the Miniſtry of his word, that he admitteth them as
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7222:95"/> ioynt-workers, and as it were fellow-labourers with him, he worketh when they worke, he exhorteth when they exhort, he reproueth when they reproue, he teacheth when they teach. This the Prophet teacheth to be the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters commiſſion giuen him of God, when he hath preached righteouſneſſe to man, <note n="h" place="margin">Iob 33, 24.</note> God will haue mercy on him, and will ſay to the Miniſter, Deliuer him that he go not downe into the pit, for I haue receiued reconciliation. This the Apoſtle ſaith, <note n="i" place="margin">2 Cor 5, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Now then are wee Ambaſſadours for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you through vs, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead that ye be reconciled to God.</hi> This our Sauiour Chriſt alſo himſelfe ſpeaketh, and auoucheth, in the perſon of <hi>Peter,</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Mat 16, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>I will giue vnto thee the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heauen, and whatſoeuer thou ſhalt binde vpon earth ſhalbe bound in Heauen, and whatſoeuer thou ſhalt looſe on earth, ſhalbe looſed in Heauen.</hi> Whereby he teacheth, that the Miniſters are the Porters of Heauen, they haue the Keyes committed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, they are appointed to bring the Children of God into the ſheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold of Chriſt. They ſhut the Kingdome of Heauen againſt all vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, by preaching, that they ſhall not enter, but be caſt into vtter darkneſſe and be tormented in Hell. They open the Kingdome of Heauen to all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers and penitent perſons, by preaching that they ſhall enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heauen and enioy eternall life. To this end and purpoſe Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to his Apoſtles after his aſcenſion, <note n="l" place="margin">Iohn 20, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Whoſe ſinnes ſoeuer ye remit, they are remitted, and whoſe ſinnes ye retaine they are retained.</hi> True it is, God onely forgiueth ſinnes properly, but he hath appointed his Miniſters to preach, publiſh, and to witneſſe to their conſciences that repent and beleeue the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, that all their ſinnes are forgiuen. And on the other ſide to preach and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that ſuch as will not beleeue and repent, ſhall neuer haue their ſinnes forgiuen them. For, how the Miniſters binde and looſe, ſhutte and open, forgiue and retaine, the Prophet Eſay ſheweth, <note n="m" place="margin">Eſay 44, 25, 26.</note> when hee ſayeth, Chapter 44. <hi>I will deſtroy the Tokens of the Sooth-ſayers, and will make them that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture, Fooles: and turne the Wiſemen backeward, and make their knowledge foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe; but he confirmeth the worde of his ſeruant, and performeth the Counſell of his Meſſengers.</hi> Whereby we ſee, that God dooth binde and looſe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue and retaine with him, when he confirmeth their worde, and performeth their Counſell. This is the Dignitie of the Miniſtery, which ſerueth to reprooue the vnthankefull world, and ignorant people, that make no recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or account of this ordinance, which is the power of God, and the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The firſt reproofe.</note> Firſt, it condemneth thoſe that thinke the Miniſters proud and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and accuſe them as ſaucie and malapart, when they commaund vs from the Lord, and checke vs for our ſinnes. It is their dutie, not onely to teach and admoniſh, to exhort, and to comfort, but to conuince and reprooue, to threaten, and to denounce Iudgements from God, againſt the obſtinate and vnrepentant. When they are ſtirred vp with boldneſſe and courage to tell the people of their ſinnes, we muſt know they do that which they may do, &amp; ſpeak no more then they ought to ſpeak: they muſt not hold their peace, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they would diſhonor their Lord that ſent them, and bring iudgment vpon their owne heads. An Embaſſador, if he ſhould not vſe the name and authoritie of his Prince, ſhould abuſe his Prince, &amp; make himſelfe liable to grieuous pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.

This is the meaſure indeed that is met vnto vs, this is the recompence that is receiued by vs, and this is the complaint that the Apoſtle maketh, <note n="p" place="margin">1 Cor 4, 9. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>I thinke that God hath ſet forth vs, the laſt Apoſtles, as men appointed to death, for we are made a gazing ſtocke vnto the world, and to the Angels, and to men; vnto this houre we both hunger and thirſt, &amp; are naked, and are buffeted, and haue no certaine dwelling place.</hi> Whereas they ſhould be regarded as the Ambaſſadors of God, and reſpected as his Stewards ſet ouer the houſe of God to diſpenſe the miſteries of life and ſaluation. True it is, great contempt lieth vpon our calling to the Miniſtry, euen as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach is laid vpon the profeſſion of Chriſt in ſincerity. The Prophet decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that his aduerſaries reioyced at his calamity, and hated him wrongfully, becauſe <note n="q" place="margin">Pſal 38, 20.</note> he followed goodneſſe, ſo do the Miniſters of the Goſpell ſuffer much hatred and contempt by wicked and prophane men, becauſe they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer their Hypocriſie and open their iniquity; yea, the word of God in their mouthes is many times as a fretting Coraſiue applied to their conſciences, that they cannot welter and wallow ſo ſecretly and ſecurely in their ſinnes, as they would and as they wonted to do. When they are reſolute and reſolued to continue in ſinne, and thinke to reſt and ſleepe quietly therein, as in a bed of eaſe, the word of God doth often raiſe them vp, and rouſe them out of their ſenceleſſe ſecurity, and ſummoneth them to the barre of Gods iudgement. This is it that troubleth their peace and their patience, this maketh them to ſpurne againſt their perſons and their calling, this cauſeth them to watch them narrowly, and to hunt after aduantages through their infirmities, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may diſgrace them: this draweth them to caſt all contempt and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour vpon their Office, that ſo their diſorders and prophaneneſſe may not be eſpied. For how ſhould they abide the Miniſters of the word, that hate the word of God? Or how ſhould they ſuffer the Ambaſſadours, that cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Ambaſſage and meſſage that they bring? But we muſt arme our ſelues againſt the ſcorne and contempt of the world, which by wicked men is caſt as mire and dirt in our faces, conſidering that we are the <note n="r" place="margin">2 Cor 2, 15.</note> ſweet ſauour of God as well in them that periſh, as in them that are ſaued. <note place="margin" type="runSum">The third re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe.</note> Thirdly, the high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of this calling, reproueth thoſe that account the Office to baſe and low for them and for their Children. Many there are that liue by the Goſpel, that are aſhamed to preach the Goſpell. They liue by the Altar, and yet are aſhamed to ſerue at the Alter. They can be content to haue the Milke and to cloth themſelues with the wooll of the ſheepe, and yet diſdaine to feed the ſheepe. Theſe are they that loue <note n="ſ" place="margin">Mat 23, 6, 7.</note> the cheife places at feaſtes, and to haue the cheife ſeates in the aſſemblies, and greetings in the Markets, and to be called of men <hi>Rabbi, Rabbi.</hi> Ambition and vaine glory haue tied vp their tongues, and made them cleaue to the roofe of their mouthes. Coueteouſneſſe and idleneſſe haue choked them and ſtopped the paſſage of their voice. Pride in themſelues and contempt of others, haue ſowed vp their lips and made them caſt the care of the flocke vpon their ſubſtitutes, who many times are as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe as their Maiſters, and in the meane ſeaſon betweene them both, the ſheep of Chriſt bought with his precious bloud, go to wracke and runne to ruine. What a ſhame is it, that any man ſhould be raiſed vp and aduanced meerely by the Goſpell, and yet account the preaching of the Goſpell a reproach to their high dignity? The ſonne of God himſelfe refuſed not to ſerue in this calling, <note n="t" place="margin">Mat 9, 35.</note> he went about al Citties and Townes teaching in their Synagogues and preaching the Goſpell of the Kingdome. If then Chriſt Ieſus the ſonne of God tooke paines in this calling, what ſonne of the earth ſhall diſdaine to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7222:96" rendition="simple:additions"/> diſcharge this office that he hath vndertaken, and by which he is maintained. Againe, ſeeing the calling is ſo excellent, why ſhould any be aſhamed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate their ſonnes to God, in the ſeruice of the Miniſtry, thereby to gaine ſoules to him and to his kingdome?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The fourth reproofe.</note> Fourthly, if it be a calling of ſuch dignity, it reprooueth thoſe that run be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be ſent, and wait not a lawful calling from God, that they diſcharge it afterward with peace of heart, and comfort of Conſcience? We ſee manie young men make more haſt then good ſpeede in entring into the Miniſtery, who for the moſt part want that iudgment, ſtaydneſſe, experience, grauity, &amp; moderation that is meet to be in men of that profeſſion. Hence it is, that they are called by the name of Elders in the Scripture. The Apoſtle thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to giue this charge to <hi>Timothy,</hi> a young man (though he were of rare hope, and of excellent guifts) <note n="u" place="margin">2 Tim. 2, 22.</note>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The fift re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe.</note> Fiftly, it reproueth thoſe, that are ſo hand-faſted, that they repine at their maintenance that labour among them. How many places and Pariſhes are there, that regard not how they be taught; or whether they be taught or not, ſo they may be well dealt withall in their Tithes; that is, if they might pay lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing to maintaine their Miniſter? There is growne in many congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations this agreement and bargaine, betweene the Paſtor and the people, if he will ſpare them in temporall things, they regarde not how hee deale with them in ſpirituall things. If they may pay little, they are content hee ſhall preach little; If they may enioy their Tithes at a low rate, they are well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that he take his eaſe, and teach them ſeldome. But albeit, he preach in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, and do his dutie with all diligence, yet they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure and repine at his allowaunce, and thinke euery thing too much, that is beſtowed that way.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The ſixt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe.</note> Laſtly, it reproueth ſuch as regard not the cenſures of the Church, inflicted vpon euill doers. The cenſures of the Church are made as a ſcar-Crow, and eſteemed of many as a mocke. But if that power and authority were regarded in the Miniſters hand, that the word of God alloweth and appointeth, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is authorized to exerciſe ſpirituall iuriſdiction in Church-matters, not onely to preach, but to puniſh; not onely to teach, but to correct; not onely to inſtruct, but to excommunicate; then would the Office be magnified, then would the Miniſtry be eſteemed according to the inſtitution of them. Our Sauiour giuing order and direction to informe the Gouernors of the Church, when ſcandals and offences aroſe among them, addeth; <note n="y" place="margin">Math. 18, 18</note> 
                  <hi>Verily I ſay vnto you, whatſoeaer ye binde on earth, ſhall be bound in Heauen; and whatſoeuer ye looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in Heauen.</hi> We ſee God promiſeth to ratifie the ſentence pronounced and denounced in his name. The abridgement of this power is the contempt of the men, and of their Miniſtry, and the curbing &amp; cutting ſhort of their authority, doth open a gappe to all contumely and reproach of their perſons and office. If a Magiſtrate ſhoulde preſcribe and ordaine that Law which is wholeſome and profitable to the Common-wealth, and haue no power at all to puniſh the Malefactors and miſdoers that tranſgreſſe, who is it that would regard the Commandement? If a School-maiſter had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity onely to rule and to teach, but were reſtrained to take vp the rod to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and chaſtiſe the obſtinat &amp; ſluggard, what Scholler would harken or giue eare to his teaching? In like manner, ſo long as the Miniſter is allowed only to ſpeake the word, or to threaten, but ſtinted that he ſhall go no farther, his Miniſtry will be little regarded; as if a Maiſter ſhould tell ſome of his Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7222:96"/> of their ſhrewde trickes, but were not licenſed to punniſh their euill doing. God hath ioyned authority to the Paſtors office, &amp; put into his hand the diſcipline of the Church, and the Miniſters of God, haue exerciſed &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted the ſame according to his ordinance. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing an heinous offence amongſt the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and ſhewing the vſe of Eccleſiaſticall correction, ſaith, <note n="z" place="margin">2 Cor. 4, 21</note>

We ſee an example heereof in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, when they heard the threatnings of the enemies of the Goſpel, <note n="b" place="margin">Acts 4, 29. &amp; 5, 28, 29.</note> 
                  <hi>They lift vp their voices to God, with one accord, and ſaid, O Lord, thou art the God, which haſt made the heauen and the earth, the ſea, and all things that are in them, beholde their threatnings, and graunt vnto thy ſeruants with all boldneſſe to ſpeak thy word.</hi> So, when the cheefe Prieſts ſaid, <hi>Did not we straightly commaund you, that yee ſhould not teach in his name?

Let euery one therefore, ſeeke to fit and furniſh himſelfe to this calling, and in Chriſt Ieſus be bold to do this dutie. This the Prophet ſaith, <note n="c" place="margin">Eſay 58, 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Crie alowd, ſpare not, lift vp thy voice like a Trumpet, and ſhew my people their tranſgreſſion, and the houſe of Iacob their ſinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This reproueth thoſe that haue the worde in reſpect of perſons, who dare not do their duties, and are afraid of mens faces. They would be counted the Embaſſadors of God, but they are affraide to do their Maiſters meſſage. Let ſuch learne of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> who ſhrunke not backe, but was bold to tell <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> that it was not lawfull for him to take his Brothers Wife. Wee muſt not bee Daſtards and faint-hearted ſouldiers, to fight the Lords battels, but firſt be ſure, we haue a good warrant out of the word, and then go boldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fielde, and feare not to looke the enemy in the face. True it is, if wee haue not our Commiſſion ſigned and ſealed vnto vs, wee haue iuſt cauſe to feare; we ſpeake in our owne names, and not in the name of God: wee ſend our ſelues, we are not ſent of him; We are our owne Meſſengers, to doe our owne Meſſage, not the Embaſſadours of the eternall God. But when hee hath put his worde in our mouths, wee muſt goe to thoſe that he hath ſent vs, <note n="d" place="margin">Ier. 1, 7, 8.</note> and whatſoeuer hee commaundeth vs, that wee muſt ſpeake. So, when God had ſtretched out his hand, and touched the mouth of the Prophet <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy,</hi> hee ſayde; <hi>Bee not affraide of their faces, for I am with thee, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thee, ſayth the Lord.</hi> Thus hee ſpeaketh to Ezekiell, <note n="e" place="margin">Exek. 3, 8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>I haue made thy Face strong againſt their Faces, and thy Fore-head harde againſt their Fore-heades, I haue made thy Fore-head as the Adamant, and harder then the Flint: Feare them not therefore, neither bee affrayde at their lookes; for they are a Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it teacheth them not to looſe their Authoritie, and ſo to ſhame their Calling, and their Mayſter that hath put them in that Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, bringing them-ſelues and their Miniſtry, vnder the ſubiection and ſlauerie of others. The Apoſtle by all meanes ſeeketh to magnifye his Miniſtery, and to beautifie his Calling. Hence he ſaith, <note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 9, 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Am not I an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, am not I free?</hi> This reprooueth thoſe that ſerue the luſtes and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of others, and dare doe nothing to diſpleaſe ſuch as are in high place.

                  <hi>to truſſe vp his loynes, to ariſe, and to ſpeake to the Children of Iſraell all that he commaunded him, not to bee affraide of their faces, leaſt he deſtroy him before them.</hi> Let vs beware of ſuch ſmooth tongues, that flatter with their lippes, and bring vs in danger of deſtruction. <hi>Salomon</hi> teacheth vs, <note n="l" place="margin">Prou. 29, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>That a man which flattereth his Neighhour, ſpreadeth a Net for his ſteppes;</hi> declaring thereby, that as a Birde which is taken in the Net, is in daunger of death; ſo they which beleeue flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, fall into great perilles of Soule, of Bodie, of Goods, of good name, of life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it teacheth the Miniſters, to take heede they abuſe not their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and turne it into tiranny, but employ it vnto edification, not to the deſtruction of the Church, or any member thereof. This the Apoſtle plainly teacheth concerning himſelfe, <note n="m" place="margin">2 Cor. 10, 8</note> 
                  <hi>Though I ſhould boast ſomwhat more of our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which the Lord hath giuen vs for edification, and not for your deſtruction, I ſhould haue no ſhame.</hi> And in another place, <note n="n" place="margin">2 Cor. 1, 24</note> 
                  <hi>Wee haue not Dominion ouer your faith, but we are helpers of your ioy, for by Faith ye stand.</hi> We muſt remember and conſider that we are vnder Chriſt: we are his Subſtitutes and Lieutenants. He is the cheefe Shepheard of the Sheepe. We muſt not beare our ſelues <note n="o" place="margin">1 Pet. 5, 3.</note> as Lords ouer his heritage, but as enſamples to the flocke. Chriſt himſelfe teſtifieth, that he was among them as one that <note n="p" place="margin">Luke 22, 27 Math. 20, 28.</note> ſerued: <hi>For the ſonne of man came not to bee ſerued, but to ſerue, and to giue his life for the ranſome of many.</hi> Let vs haue the ſame mind in vs, that was in chriſt Ieſus; let vs behaue our ſelues as Stewards, not as Lords; as Officers, not as Princes; as Miniſters, not as Vſurpers; as Stewards, not as Maiſters of the houſe.</p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 3.</note> Laſtly, it ſerueth for inſtruction of the people, that they deſpiſe not the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the word, but alway readie to heare it with reuerence. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer there is authority in the ſpeaker, there ſhould bee feare and reuerence in the hearer. They are Embaſſadors ſent, not from Man, but from God; they ſpeake not in their owne names, but in the name of God; they publiſh not their owne Dreames or deuiſes, but the Doctrine of God, and therefore ought reuerently and obediently to be regarded.

Hence it is that our Sauiour Chriſt ſayth, <note n="r" place="margin">Luke 10, 16</note> 
                  <hi>Hee that heareth you, heareth me, and he that heareth you, heareth him that ſent mee.</hi> The Prophet teacheth, that their feete are beautifull that bring gladde tydings of peace, and bring glad tydinges of good things. They are ſaide to be worthy of double honor, and to

If a man had loſt a precious Iewell, and Rich Pearle, which was all the riches and ſubſtance of his houſe, and beeing in this caſe, ſhould meete with a man that can tell him who robbed him of it, where it is, and how hee may come to haue it againe, how would hee reſpect him, and reward him?

The Deuill is the Theefe; Chriſt doth reſtore it: Faith applyeth Chriſt, the Word of God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Faith; the Miniſter preacheth the word whereby we beleeue. How well dooſt thou account of that Phyſitian, and how highly doeſt thou eſteeme of him, who when thy health is loſt, and ſickneſſe falne vpon thee, can tell thy diſeaſe, open the cauſe of it, ſhew thee the cure and remedy of it, and reſtore thee to thy former ſtate and ſtrength; ſo when thy ſoul is ſick vnto the death, and euen to damnation, the man of God can heale the deadly wound that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath giuen, and apply a ſoueraigne plaiſter for thee, made of the precious blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>From hence all men may learne, how to eſteeme Gods Miniſters, and with what affection we are to heare them. The Sheepe of Chriſt <note n="t" place="margin">Ioh. 10, 27.</note> will heare his voice and follow him. This is a notable token to know the children of God by: to diſobey the Miniſters of God, is to diſobey God himſelfe; &amp; to deſpiſe their word, is to deſpiſe the word of God himſelfe. Is not the Embaſſador of an earthly Prince receiued with great honor &amp; reuerence? Is not his meſſage receiued as vndoubtedly as if the Prince himſelfe were preſent? Are not they which deſpiſe his authority as heinouſly puniſhed, and as vilely accounted of, as if they reſiſted and rebelled againſt the Kings owne perſon? Shall then the Meſſengers of the liuing God, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued leſſe worthily then the other, whoſe authority is greater, who meſſage is waightier, whoſe place is higher? It is requiſite therefore, that the people feare and reuerence their Miniſter, or elſe they wil in no caſe honor and obey him. For where feare is not preſent, all honour is abſent; &amp; whoſoeuer ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to performe this dutie of feare, let him be well aſſured, hee contemneth not him, but the Lord that ſent him. This feare is to be yeelded, not to his perſon, but to his Office. For as the Apoſtle exhorteth the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> to <note n="u" place="margin">1 Theſ. 5, 12, 13.</note> acknowledge them that laboured among them, and haue them in ſingular loue for their workes ſake; ſo wee ought to feare thoſe that are ſet ouer vs in the Lord, for their worker ſake. So he witneſſeth that the <hi>Galathians</hi> 
                  <note n="x" place="margin">Gal. 4, 14.</note> recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him as an Angel of God; yea more then ſo, they receiued him as Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe. This was not as he was a man, but as the Miniſter of God: this was not for the excellency of his perſon, which hee acknowledgeth to be ſimple, and teſtifieth to be contemptible; but hee was receiued for that excellent meſſage which he brought among them. Therefore <hi>Paule</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the <hi>Phillippians,</hi> ſayth, <note n="y" place="margin">Phil. 2, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>As yee haue alwayes obeyed mee, not as in my preſence onely, but now much more in my abſence, ſo make an end of your ſaluation with feare and trembling.</hi> This reprooueth all thoſe that are ſtubborne and diſobedient, and wil not obey the word of exhortation deliuered vnto them: ſuch alſo, as heare not often and conſtantly, but ſeldome and careleſſely, as if they were perſwaded, that they had nothing to do with God, or God with his word: ſuch as when they heare are not ſtricken with any feare of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, or of the power of the word, or of the truth that is deliuered, ſo that they neuer can heare aright, ſeeing GOD accounteth thoſe only the right Hearers, <note n="z" place="margin">Eſa. 66, 2, 5.</note> that tremble at his Worde, and are of humble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite hearts.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſuch as are content to heare and liſten with their outward eares, but it is no longer then they liſt, and no farther then their owne fantaſies
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7222:98"/> are fed, and their deſires followed, and their humors pleaſed. They are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to heare, vntill their ſpeciall ſinnes be reprooued: but when they finde themſelues touched, or their iniquities (which they dwell in) diſcouered, they grow out of patience, and begin to reuile and raile at the Miniſters that ſeeke with a good Conſcience to diſcharge their duties. This is an euident note of a corrupt hearer, and a plaine teſtimony of an euill heart. We muſt be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to heare the curſes of the Law, as well as the promiſes of the Goſpel: we muſt account it a benefit to be reproued our ſelues, as well as to heare others reproued. A ſicke man would not content himſelfe to haue the Phyſitian ſhew vnto others their diſeaſes, but would haue his owne diſeaſe diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto him; ſo is it profitable vnto vs, to ſee our owne ſinnes, and to heare our owne corruptions reuealed and manifeſted vnto vs. If we once deſire to come out of our ſinnes and iniquities wherein wee haue liued; if once they become bitter and vnpleaſant vnto vs, it will bee no griefe or burthen, to ſee our ſelues ſtripped, and layde open to the view and ſight of the worlde. Let vs therefore with meekeneſſe of ſpirit ſubmit our ſelues to the ſtroke of Gods word, and not rage when wee are reprooued, as the manner of thoſe is, that purpoſe to perſeuer, and to continue in their ſinnes vnto the end.</p>

                     <bibl>Verſe 9.</bibl> [<hi>Yet for your loues ſake I rather beſeech thee.</hi>]</q> Heere we haue the ſecond part of the diuers reaſon before remembred. The former Verſe, was a preparation or entraunce into the prayer or petition of Paule, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the authoritie that he had (if hee would vſe it) to command <hi>Philemon</hi> that which was conuenient for him to do. Theſe words are a mild mittigation of the former; namely, that albeit he might commaund him by his office, yet he would rather entreat and beſeech him thorough loue. The Apoſtle ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to do in this place with a matter of Chriſtian moderation and equitie, wherein hee might from the Lord command with authoritie, doth notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding pray and beſeech; and when hee might lawfully vrge and require the practiſe thereof, hee rather reſolueth to vſe gentle, humble, and louing meanes. <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Doctrine</hi> 2. Gentle means are to bee vſed rather then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men to the truth.</note> The Doctrine ariſing from hence, is this; That the Seruants of God, ought to vſe mildneſſe and meekeneſſe in deliuering the will and meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of God to his people, rather intreating them with lenitie, then comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them with authoritie, albeit they haue libertie ſo to do. Courteous and gentle meanes are firſt to be vſed, if they may preuaile, rather then checking and chiding ſharpely and rigorouſly with Offenders. We ſee this in Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe, who did not breake the bruiſed reede, nor quench the ſmoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Flaxe, hee ſayth, <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 11, 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Come vnto mee all yee that are weary and heauie laden, and I will eaſe you, for my yoake is eaſie, and my burden is light.</hi> This appeareth in ſundry places of Paules Epiſtles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12, 1. <hi>I beſeech you Brethren by the mercies of Christ; that ye giue vp your bodies a liuing Sacrifice, holy, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto God, which is your reaſonable ſeruing of God.</hi> So, 2 Cor. 5, 20. <hi>Now then are we Ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you through vs, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead, that ye bee reconciled to God.</hi> And in the tenth Chapter of the ſame Epiſtle, <note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor. 10, 1.</note> 
                  <hi>I Paule my ſelfe, beſeech you, by the meekneſſe and gentleneſſe of Christ, which when I am preſent among you, am baſe, but am bolde toward you being abſent.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh, <note n="e" place="margin">1 Pet. 2, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Dearly beloued, I beſeech you as Pilgrims and Straungers, abſtaine from fleſhly luſts which fight againſt the ſoule, and haue your conuerſation honest among the Gentiles.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> writing to a Noble woman by byrth but more noble by Faith and Religion, ſaieth, <note n="f" place="margin">2 Iohn 5.</note> 
                  <hi>I now beſeech thee (Ladie) not as writing a newe Commaundement vnto thee, but the ſame that wee had from the beginning, that wee loue one another.</hi> Whereby we ſee, that it is a dutie required of vs, that in deliuering the word of God, &amp; in declaring his will, we ſhould vſe milde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe rather then ſharpeneſſe; gentleneſſe, rather then roughneſſe; beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 1.</note> Now to confirme this doctrine, ſundry reaſons may be rendred and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Firſt, we are bound to vſe thoſe meanes, and to take that courſe, which is moſt forcible &amp; effectual. But to deale with loue and lenity, and to handle our brethren kindly and meekly, is moſt likely to preuaile with moſt men. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle requireth, <note n="g" place="margin">2 Tim. 2, 25.</note> that the ſeruant of God muſt not ſtriue, but muſt be gentle toward al men, apt to teach, ſuffering the euil, inſtructing them with meekneſſe that are contrary minded, prouing if God at any time wil giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> repentance, that they may acknowledge the truth, and come to amendment, out of the ſnare of the deuil, &amp;c. There is no way ſo auaileable to bring euill men out of the dangers wherin they ſtand, who are as it were taken priſoners, and made bondſlaues to do the Deuils wil, then to allure them by gentleneſſe, to draw them by long ſuffering, and to ouercome them by patience.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 2.</note> Secondly, this courſe well and duely obſerued, ſerueth to perſwade them with whome wee deale of our loue and tender affection towardes them. For louing and friendly dealing, argueth louing and affectionate mindes, and with whomſoeuer we haue to doo, it is a great meanes of preuailing, and the readie way to bend and encline him vnto that which is good, and to turne him from that which is euill, when his perſwaſions are perceyued to tend to the profite and benefite of him whome wee would perſwade. Wee ſhall neuer doo any good, or preuayle with our Brother, to bring him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the right way, vnleſſe hee can aſſure his owne heart that wee loue him, and ſeeke his good, and deſire his Saluation. It is Loue in the Speaker, that mooueth the Hearer to embrace that which hee ſpeaketh, to like that which hee teacheth, to hate that which hee reprooueth, to auoyde that which hee condemneth, and to practiſe that which hee commendeth. Wee muſt worke this Opinion, and ground this perſwaſion in their hearts, that wee loue them, and that all our Doctrines, Inſtructions, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes, proceede onely from this Fountaine, before wee can mooue them to Attention, Reuerence, and Obedience, vnto that which they heare deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle in ſundrie places, writing to diuers Churches, and moouing them to followe the examples and exhortations giuen vnto them, laboureth to perſwade them of his vnfaigned Loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes them, as it appeareth, <hi>Phillippians</hi> 4, 1. <hi>Therefore, my Bretheren, beloued and longed for, my ioy, and my Crowne, ſo continue in the Lorde, yee beloued.</hi>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 3.</note> Thirdly, we are to imitate our Head and Maiſter Chriſt Ieſus, he vſed not his Authoritie and Power that was in him, he dealt not roughly and ſeuerely with his enemies, but meekely and mercifully, and moſt compaſsionately, he was meeke, and as a Lambe before his ſhearer. When he might according to his mightie power in Iuſtice haue deſtroyed his Perſecuters and enemies, <note n="h" place="margin">Luke 23, 34</note> he prayed for them, he intreated pardon for them, that their ſinne might bee forgiuen. Therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth vs, that we are prouoked to a patient bearing of wrongs, and ſuffering of trobles, by the example of Chriſt, ſaying, <note n="i" place="margin">1 Pet. 2, 21.</note>

The truth heereof we ſee practiſed in <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> when <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi> was apprehended, and his ſinne diſcouered, whereby hee had offended God, ſinned againſt his expreſſe commandement, and troubled <hi>Iſraell,</hi> he ſaid vnto him, <note n="l" place="margin">Ioſh. 7, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>My ſonne, I beſeech thee, giue glory to the Lord God of Iſrael, &amp; make confeſſion vnto him, and ſhew me now what thou haſt done, hide it not from me.</hi> Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty in deed, or bitterneſſe in word, euen toward euill doers that are alreadie adiudged, or ſtand at the barre to be iudged, is barbarous and inhumain. To inſult ouer a poore priſoner, or a condemned man that is guilty of death, and carried to the place of execution, ſtandeth neither with an humaine diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor with a Chriſtian affection, nor with Brotherly compaſsion. Beholde the proud and inſolent behauiour of the ſauage and beaſtly minded Phariſees and Prieſts againſt our Sauiour Chriſt, mocking, ſpitting, buffeting, rayling, reuiling, whipping, and crucifieng him betweene two theeues. They were not content to ſeeke his life, and to ſhed his blood, but laded him with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and all ſhamefull calumniations. This alſo is the practiſe of their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors the Romiſh Cleargy, who are the followers of them in malice and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when the faithfull haue beene, not only conuented before them, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of them, they haue embrued their hands, and defiled their garments with their blood, which cryeth to the God of Heauen for iudgement; neither were they contented to feede their eyes with their torments, and to ſatisfie their luſts with their ſufferings, but proceeded to all extreamities of rage and madneſſe, rayling at them, and ſpeaking all manner of euil againſt them. This abuſe is ſomtimes too vſual and common in the places of Iuſtice &amp; iudgment, from whence all gall and bitterneſſe ſhould be baniſhed: wee may heare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly ieſts, bitter taunts, &amp; vncharitable reproches caſt out of their mouths (as a loathſome vomit out of the ſtomacke) who ſhould <hi>Remember that they ſit in the ſeat of God,</hi>

We muſt regard not onely what we do, but in what ſort and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to what end and purpoſe wee doo it. It is our dutie to ſhew Mercie and Loue to Offenders, euen in punniſhing of Offenders.

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> Againe, it may be ſaide, that the Prophet <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 109. and in many other places, <note n="r" place="margin">Pſ. 59, &amp; 109</note> prayed for the deſtruction of his enemies, both their perſons and poſteritie.

               <p>Againe, the imprecations of the Prophets, are propheſied of plagues to come, but we haue no ſuch extraordinarie inſtinct reuealed vnto vs, to knowe what is to come: wherefore, wee cannot alledge their examples for our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, we muſt walke in the Kings High way, and follow the generall rules of the Scripture, to deale mildly, to put away pride and cruelty toward thoſe that are vnder vs, to baniſh tiranny; and treading of them vnder our feet. This is to be obſerued of all Fathers, Maiſters, and Gouernors, remembring that in Chriſt we are all Brethren, that by Nature we are all of one mold and making, that (as men) we haue all one Creator. This conſideration wee finde to haue <note n="ſ" place="margin">Iob 32, 13, 14.</note> bin in <hi>Iob</hi> toward thoſe of his Family. <hi>If I did contemne the iudgement of my Seruant, and of my Maide, when they did contend with me; what then ſhall I doo when God ſtandeth vp?

So ſhould we, when we execute our Office, firſt offer peace before we proclaime warre; firſt, allure by Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, before we thunder out iudgements; firſt, exhort, before we threaten. In the materiall building, all the ſtones that are to be fitted to the building, are not of one nature, ſome are ſoft and eaſie to be hewed and hammered, others more hard and of a flintier marble diſpoſition, they require ſharp tooles, ſtrong blowes, &amp; ſturdy armes, before they can bc brought into forme, or be ſquared for their place which they are to hold. So it is with the liuely ſtones of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Temple of God, ſome haue ſoft hearts of fleſh, &amp; are of humble &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite ſpirits, like the bruiſed reed or the ſmoaking flaxe, others haue hearts hard as the Adament, and cannot eaſily be brought to feele the ſtrokes of the word of God. Theſe are not to be dealt withall and handled alike, but after a diuerſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner. This is the counſel of the Apoſtle <hi>Iude,</hi> 
                  <note n="z" place="margin">Iude 1, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Haue compaſſion of ſome, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting difference, and other ſaue with feare, pulling them out of the fire, and hate euen that Garment which is ſpotted by the fleſh.</hi> This ſerueth to reproue, firſt, ſuch as vſe vnſeaſonable lenity, when Godly ſeuerity is required. Some diſeaſes, require ſharpe medicines. This is a great ſinne, whether it be in the family, in the common Wealth, or in the Church. <hi>Ely</hi> heard many complaints againſt his ſonnes, that they ſinned againſt God, and cauſed his people to abhorre his offerings, yet he did beare with them, and was not ſharpe toward them as he ought to haue beene, <note n="a" place="margin">1 Sam 2, 23.</note> he ſaid vnto them, <hi>Why do ye ſuch things? for of all this people I heare euill reports of you: do no more, my ſonnes, for it is no good report that I heare, which is, that ye make the Lordes people to treſpaſſe.</hi> He ſhewed mercy, where he ſhould ſhew ſeuerity, and he winked at thoſe that were worthy to be puniſhed. This proceedeth not from a loue to our Children, but rather from a looſeneſſe in our ſelues, and a careleſneſſe of their good and ſaluation. This cauſeth vice to encreaſe and maketh ſinne grow in all places. The like wee ſee in <hi>Ahab</hi> King of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> when God had deliuered a cruell enemy into his hand, he ſpared him, <note n="b" place="margin">1 King, 20, 42.</note> and ſuffered him to eſcape out of his hands, a man whom God appointed to die, and thereby is threatned, that his owne life ſhould redeeme and ranſome the life of his enimy, and ſo the one pay the price of the other. The like we might handle in <hi>Saule,</hi> who receiuing a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to deſtroy <hi>Agag,</hi> and his ſubſtance, together with the <hi>Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites,</hi>

This negligence in puniſhing offenders is too common in the common Wealth, and is a meanes to increaſe ſinne, to ſee ſinne puniſhed. It is a true ſaying of the wiſe man, <note n="d" place="margin">Prou 20, 30</note>

When the inceſtuous perſon among the <hi>Corrinthians</hi> was (according to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God,) to be caſt out, he was ſuffered in the Church, and had not the cenſures of the Church executed againſt him, <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor 5, 6.</note> ſo that the Apoſtle telleth them, that their reioycing was not good, <hi>Know ye not that a little leauen leaueneth the whole lumpe? purge out therefore the old leauen, that ye may be a new lumpe.</hi> Such was the careleſneſſe and coldneſſe in many of the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Reuel 2, &amp; 4</note> they were too milde toward Heretikes and euill liuers, and ſuffered the ſword of excommunication to ruſt in the ſheath, which ſhould be drawne out to the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and feare of all ſtubborne and vnrepentant ſinners. Secondly, it repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſuch as are too ſharpe and rigorous, againſt offenders, and forget all rules

The auncient Church in former times offended this way being ſo auſtere and ſeuere againſt offenders, who for ſmall offences enioyned puniſhment for the ſpace of many yeares. This is the ſinne of ſuch as are of the ſeparation, and haue departed from our Churches, condemning our Church to be no Church, our Miniſters to be no Miniſters, our ſacraments to be no ſacraments, refuſing to heare the word at our mouthes, to pray and communicate with our people, and to performe other religious duties with vs. Thus they haue noted and marked vs out with the blacke cole of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, who deſerue rather to be excommunicated by vs, had they not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily excommunicated themſelues from vs. On the other ſide, it behoueth vs to ſhew compaſſion to them that ſinne of ignorance or infirmity, and to ſeaſon our admonitions and exhortations with a louing affection, let vs beare with them ſo long as we ſee any hope of amendment, following the example of <hi>Moſes,</hi> 
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Exod 32, 31.</note> who mourned and prayed for the <hi>Iſralites</hi> fallen in Idolatry, and of Chriſt, <note n="i" place="margin">Luke 19, 41.</note> who wept ouer <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to make them weepe for their ſinnes, who ſeemed to haue no ſight or feeling of them.

Hence it is, that the Pope and his Biſhops threaten Princes, chalenge authority to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them, to depoſe them, and to diſcharge their ſubiects of ſubiection and alleageance. This is cruelty ioyned with impiety, this is ſeuerity accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Hipocriſie, this is curſing and banning, contrary to the Chriſtian faith, and therefore being cauſeleſſe they cannot come.</p>

The ſinne of contempt and contumacy is fearefull, when the bountifulneſſe of God is deſpiſed, his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies loathed, his patience and long ſuffering abuſed.

This is the order which the Apoſtle teacheth to be obſerued by the Lord himſelfe, in the firſt place, by patience and long ſuffering he calleth men to repentance, neuertheleſſe if they will not turne vnto him,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7222:101"/> but harden their hearts againſt the meanes and Miniſtry that he vſeth to call them, he hoardeth and heapeth vp wrath for them againſt the day of wrath. This hath beene the dealing of God with vs in this Land more then fifty years, he hath preached vnto vs by his mercies, he hath intreated vs and prouoked vs by peace, by plenty, by patience, by temporall bleſſings, by ſpirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, by proſperity which the glorious Goſpell of Chriſt hath brought with it, he hath planted his Vine among vs, he hath looked for good fruit anſweara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuch great meanes and long mercies. But what haue we perfourmed according to that which God hath expected? and how haue we behaued our ſelues in reſpect of this bountifulneſſe which we haue taſted and receiued? Surely, we become euery yeare worſe then other, <note n="l" place="margin">Eſay 5, 4.</note> more barren, and leſſe fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; we are not onely void of good fruits, but full of euill fruits, bearing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but leaues of vanity, and ſhewes of Hipocriſie. We cannot deny, but God (as a carefull dreſſer of his Vineyard) hath often times beene conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to take his pruning knife into his handes, he hath ſcourged vs by famine, and chaſtened vs by plague and peſtilence; yea, ſtill doth viſit vs in ſundry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and yet though he haue put vs into the furnace, and tried vs with the fire of his iudgements, he cannot purge out our droſſe, or take away our tinne, or cleanſe away our corruptions from vs, but ſtill we ſwarue from him, &amp; ſwarue with blaſphemies, with oathes, with prophaneneſſe, with drunkenneſſe, with whoredome, with contempt of the Goſpell; we abound with the fruits of the fleſh, and workes of darkneſſe, which agree not with that light into which we are brought. The word of God was more reuerently eſteemed, better regarded, and more carefully practiſed thirty; yea, forty yeares agone, then it is in theſe declining times in which we liue. We haue a long time gone backward, and not forward; we grow downeward, and not vpward; wee are farther from the Kingdome of Heauen, and not neerer. What then remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth for vs, <note n="m" place="margin">Heb 10, 27.</note> but a fearefull looking for of iudgment and violent fire, which ſhall deſtroy his aduerſaries? If he open the Treaſures of his wrath, and the ſtore-houſes of his iudgements, if he bring forth the arrowes of his quiuer, and draw his ſword out of his ſheath, let vs prepare to meet our God by vnfained repentance, let vs forſake our ſinnes which bring all curſes and callamities vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs. If his mercies will not moue vs, his iudgements ſhall remoue vs out of our places.

If they will not know vs, it is lawfull for vs to knowe our ſelues. If they contemne vs and caſt vs at their feete, wee muſt learne to magnifie and make much of our Callinges and Guiftes. This reprooueth and condemneth thoſe that diſpraiſe and diſable them-ſelues too much, wherein there may be as cloſe and ſecret Pride, as in them that riſe vppe earely to praiſe themſelues. Wee muſt not denie the graces of GOD that are in vs, but acknowledge them to the praiſe of God, and ſubmit our ſelues to the iudgement of others, that will not flatter for vs for that we haue not, nor craftily conceale that which we haue.</p>

Firſt, it is required of them to praiſe and commend the Guiftes of God in them, and giue the glory of them to God the giuer. We muſt magnifie them, and preferre them before all others that haue not the ſame Guiftes, though they be our enemies and ſuch as hate vs. Wee muſt not ſo much conſider their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, how they are affected toward vs, as their Guiftes, they are the Guiftes of God, and therefore ſhould be acknowledged and approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. They haue worthy Guiftes that we want, and yet are giuen for our good and benefite. Wee do not ſee their Guiftes ſo defiled with infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and mingled with Corruptions as our owne are; all which thinges ſhould helpe to adde Grace and Glory to the Guiftes that are in others. When <hi>Pharaoh</hi> perceiued the great Wiſedome that was in <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Gen 41, 43. Pſal 150, 22.</note> hee ſpared not to ſpeake of it, hee ſhamed not to place him ouer all the Land of <hi>Egipt,</hi> to make him Lord of his houſe, and Ruler of all his ſubſtance, that he ſhould binde his Princes vnto his will, and teach his Auncients wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. So when <hi>Nebucadnezzer</hi> ſaw that <hi>Daniell</hi> was indued with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and vnderſtanding from aboue, more then all the Aſtrologians and Enchaunters that were in <hi>Babilon,</hi> he doth confeſſe them to be in him, and reuerence him for them. So ought we all to do when we heare or behold the guiftes of God in our bretheren, let vs acknowledge them and praiſe God for them.</p>
               <p>This reproueth the common practiſe of thoſe that will diminiſh and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace their guifts, and like of nothing but that which is in themſelues. Let vs beware of Pride and Enuy, diſdaining others, deprouing, and leſſening ſuch inward graces of Gods ſpirit as are in them. If another man ſhould not readily acknowledge their outward guiftes wherein they glory, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence them for their Parentage, Titles, and dignities, they would thinke themſelues wronged, and diſgraced, they would be ready to caſt them in the teeth with forgetfulneſſe of their duty. Why then ſhould not they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the inward guifts and heauenly graces that appeare in their bretheren, which are farre more excellent then the former? Secondly, it is our
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7222:103"/> duty to make profit of the guifts of our Superiours, and take benefit by them. This is the end for which they were giuen by God himſelfe, and this is the vſe that we muſt make of them. It is a great bleſſing of God, when hee is gratious and bountifull vnto his people, and largely and liberally beſtoweth his bleſſings vpon them: we haue many examples of godlineſſe, of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of patience, of meekneſſe, of mercy, and many other gifts in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo that we may take counſell and comfort from them. Yea, as we are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reuerence theſe guifts in others, ſo we muſt labour to feele them in our ſelues, and to keepe them in the Cloſſet of our owne hearts. It is aſhame to ſee others religious, and to bee without Religion in our ſelues? To ſee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers godlie, and our ſelues to be without godlineſſe? To ſee ſo many graces in our Bretheren, and we remaine without grace? This is a plaine argument, that wee eſteeme nothing at all, and make no reckoning or account of any good guiftes in our Brethren, for as much as we are not deſirous to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of them our ſelues. For whatſoeuer we regard in others, we will labour to haue and enioy our ſelues.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it behooueth all young perſons, to conceiue a reuerent opinion, and to carry a dutifull and diſcreet behauiour toward their elders, that are more auncient then they in yeares. Old men are in ſtead of Fathers, <note n="x" place="margin">1. Tim. 5, 1.</note> and the Apoſtle would haue them to be exhorted as Fathers. Againe, old age is a bleſſing of God, which few obtaine and attaine vnto, in compariſon of the reſt. The contempt of it, is the contempt of God, and a deriding of his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, as appeareth by the commaundement expreſſed. Leuit. 19. When the Lord had preſcribed a reuerent behauiour toward aged men, hee addeth; <note n="y" place="margin">Leui. 19, 32.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt dread thy God, I am the Lord:</hi> declaring thereby, that where there is want of reuerence to their perſons, there is the want of the feare of God, for he ioyneth riſing vp before the Elders, and the reuerencing of God toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Where the feare of God is not, there can bee no duty performed to men. This reprooueth the rudeneſſe, the common and cuſtomable ſauſineſſe that is in young perſons, that refuſe to giue them liberty and freedome to ſpeake before them. In all Companies, the younger is the readier to ſpeake, although he vtter nothing but words of folly and of vanity. Likewiſe, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooueth thoſe that will not giue them roome and place when they come in preſence. It is vndecent and vncomely in the Church or elſe-where, to ſee weake and feeble olde Men ſtand, and young Boyes to ſit downe on their ſeats, without wagging, ſtirring, or giuing place vnto them. This is directlie contrary to the Law of God; <hi>Thou ſhalt riſe vp before the hore-head, and honor the perſon of the old man.</hi> We may now renew the complaint of the Prophet, in regard of this concluſion; <note n="z" place="margin">Eſay 3, 5.</note>

Let ſuch as haue good guifts, imploy them to the greateſt good of others. He that hath receiued much, muſt bring forth much fruit, <note n="a" place="margin">Math. 25, 20</note> as the Seruant that had fiue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents committed vnto him, gained fiue other talents. So old men muſt be graue and ſober, and carry a Maieſty in their countenance, that they may after a ſort reſemble the Maieſty of God. As grauity and ſobriety agreeth to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry age, ſo moſt eſpecially to the elder age; contrary to which, is lightneſſe, laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuiouſneſſe, and waywardneſſe, which make them not honorable, but odious; not to be reuerenced, but to be diſpiſed in the eies of the younger ſort. Let them adorne their yeares with thoſe vertues <note n="b" place="margin">Tit. 2, 1, 2.</note> which the Apoſtle nameth. <hi>Let the elder-men be watchfull, graue, temperate, ſound in the faith, in loue, and in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</hi> If they be carefull to expreſſe theſe thinges which become wholeſome doctrine, they ſhall manifeſtly ſhew, that their liuing ſo long in the World
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7222:103"/> hath not beene in vaine. The Wiſe man <note n="c" place="margin">Prou. 20, 29.</note> ſaith, <hi>The beautie of the young men is their ſtrength, and the glory of the aged is the gray-headed;</hi> that is, Wiſedom, Counſell, Experience, whereby they are more adorned, then the young man is beautified by his bodily ſtrength. For, the Ornaments of the minde are to be preferred before the properties of the bodie. Againe, they muſt bee examples of a godly life, and holye conuerſation, that youth may ſtand in feare to commit any vndecent and vnſeemely thing in their preſence. Thus <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith of himſelfe, <note n="d" place="margin">Iob. 29, 7.</note> Chap. 29. <hi>When I went out of the gate, the young Men ſaw me, and hid themſelues.</hi> But when the Elder ſort are Ring-leaders aad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of an euill and corrupt life, there is more grauity on their heads, then piety in their hearts; in their white haires, then in their behauiour; and ſo the Crowne of honour is taken from them, and they are iuſtly contemned, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and reproached of thoſe, of whom they ſhould be honoured. For, wee may ſee olde men ſo hardned in Wickedneſſe, that if a man would find whole heapes of wickedneſſe, he neede ſeeke no farther, but to them. Some, by their age and long experience, haue learned nothing but craft and ſpightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo as if a man ſhould frame himſelfe after their example, he ſhould haue neither faithfulneſſe in him, nor vpright dealing. Others are looſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered in their whole life. Some haue beene giuen to ſwearing and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming in their youth, and they are not reformed; nay they are more defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in their age. Others, are ſo drenched and ſapped in Couetouſneſſe and Whoredome, as that they infect all places, and defile all perſons where they come, they delight in ſuch rotten and filthy communication, that euen yong men are aſhamed to heare them ſpew out ſuch vngodly and vnſauoury talke. Such as lead their liues as Fathers in the Church, and adorne their age with godlineſſe, ſhall not neede to be offended at theſe things, nor to ſay with the Lawyers in the Goſpell, <note n="e" place="margin">Luke 11, 45.</note> 
                  <hi>In ſaying this, thou putteſt we to rebuke alſo.</hi> We are all to honour the gray-head, and to magnifie old age: For (as <hi>Salomon</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Prou. 16, 31.</note> ſaith) <hi>Age is a Crowne of Glorie, when it is found in the way of Righteouſneſſe;</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee meaneth, that olde age ſeaſoned with a Godly life and vpright, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with it as great glorie, as a Crowne on the heade, and a Scepter in the hand dooth vnto a King; and therefore ſuch olde men are greatly to be reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced, and highly to be eſteemed. But many, except they ſhould be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for their Ignoraunce, Superſtition, Frowardneſſe, Maliciouſneſſe, Way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe, Couetouſneſſe, Drunkenneſſe, Licentiouſneſſe, and Selfe-will, there is nothing elſe to be found in them, to be learned of them, to be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from them. By theſe foule enormities, they bring themſelues into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and bring ſhame and reproach vpon their owne heades; ſo that no man defameth and diſhonoureth them ſo much as themſelues. For, doe they behaue themſelues with ſuch Stayedneſſe, Wiſedome, and Grauity, that yong men feare to behaue themſelues lewdly and licentiouſly in their ſight? Or do they ſhew themſelues examples of good thinges? Nay, they ſerue for nothing but to corrupt and infect youth, they be patternes, nay Patrons and Maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of all filthineſſe and looſe liuing. Surely, if young men miſ-behaue and miſgouerne themſelues, they are not to be excuſed, but to be reprooued, becauſe they ought to order their liues aright, <note n="g" place="margin">Eccles. 12, 1.</note> and <hi>Remember their Creator in the dayes of their youth;</hi> and not deſerue to bee euill ſpoken or reported of: but Olde folke, are double worthy of the ſhame that men doo them, if they bee not honoured for their Vertues. They ſhould learne by their long life, and olde age, to growe in the knowledge of GOD, and his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt; to hate ſinne, to delight in righteouſneſſe, and daily to dye vnto the Worlde, that as they beare about them a bodie declining and decaying in ſtrength, ſo they ſhould bee renewed in the inner man, long after eternall life, and not neſtle them-ſelues heere vppon the earth, as if they ſhoulde continue for euer therein, nor purſue ſo greedily after the Worlde, when
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7222:104"/> they can ſcarſe go or creepe vp and downe in the world. It is a teſtimonie of Gods great mercy toward vs, when he lengthneth our life, and prolongeth our dayes to the laſt period and power of Nature; Oh, how might wee haue profited in the knowledge of Religion, in the feare of God, in the wayes of godlineſſe, in the meanes of ſaluation, and in good example of life? If wee had learned, ſince wee entered into Chriſtianity, but nowe a little, and then a little; heere a Precept, and there a Precept; we might (in ſhort ſpace) haue attained to a great meaſure of vnderſtanding, and bee daily fitted to Gods Kingdome. But alas, ſuch as ſhould bee olde in Faith, are verie Babes and Children, a thing greatly diſgracefull and reproachfull to their yeares &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle chargeth the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 
                  <note n="h" place="margin">1 Cor. 14, 20 Epheſ. 4, 14.</note> that they ſhould not be Children in vnderſtanding, as concerning maliciouſneſſe, hee would haue them Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but in vnderſtanding to be of ripe age. Whereby wee ſee, that aged perſons do quite degenerat from that which they ought to be, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine voyde of knowledge, and deſtitute of ſpirituall Wiſedome, and ſuffer many that are young in yeares, to ouertake them, yea to ouer ſtrip them, and go many degrees before them. If a man ſhould binde his ſonne an Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe to ſome Science or Occupation, and when he had ſerued his time, ſhould be to ſeeke in his trade, and bee neuer a whit the more his Crafts-maiſter, in the ending of his yeares, then he was at the beginning, we would thinke hee had loſt his time, and complaine of the iniury of the Maiſter, or of the careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Seruant. If a Father ſhould put his ſonne to Schoole, and hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes continue in the loweſt Fourme, and neuer aſcend higher, wee woulde iudge great negligence to be eyther in the Maiſter, or in the Scholler. Behold the Church of God is the Schoole of Chriſt, and the beſt place to learne the Science of all Sciences, if we haue liued long therein, ſome of vs twenty, ſome thirty, ſome forty yeares, and ſome longer, and yet be no wiſer in Religion, then a childe of ſeauen yeares old, <note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 5, 12.</note> is it not aſhame for vs, and may wee not bee condemned of great negligence in the matters of our ſaluation? Let vs examine our ſelues how wee haue profited, and compare our proceeding in knowledge with the length of time that God hath graunted vnto vs. He may iuſtly require great things of vs, and challenge at our hands much fruite, who hath affoorded vnto vs, great meanes for our growth and encreaſing in all good things.</p>

To his requeſt, hee annexeth diuers reaſons: firſt, becauſe he begat him; that is, brought him by the preaching of the Goſpell, to the true Chriſtian faith, and therefore he is earneſt to intreat for him. Secondly, becauſe his Maiſter ſhould now finde him profitable vnto him; that is, faithfull, truſty, and ſeruiceable, for ſo will true Chriſtian ſeruants be; whereas ſuch as are vngodly, will be vnfaithful, and ſuch as haue not the feare of God before them, cannot anſwere the truſt that is repoſed in them for Conſcience ſake. Thirdly, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> loued <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus</hi> tenderly and deerely, as his owne bowelles, not as a ſeruant, but as his ſon; not onely as a Brother, but as his owne bowels.

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The meaning of the words.</note> Let vs breefely ſee the Interpretation of this Verſe, and reſerue the reſt to his proper place. Firſt of all, when hee calleth <hi>Oneſimus</hi> his ſonne, hee meaneth it not in reſpect of the naturall birth and generation, but of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and ſuper-naturall. So that by a borrowed ſpeech he meaneth, one brought to his Faith by his Miniſtry. Likewiſe when he ſaith, [<hi>Whom I haue begotten,</hi>] the meaning is, whom God by mee did effectually call to embrace and beleeue the Goſpell. It is not the worke of a mortall man to frame and reforme the ſoule vnto the Image of God. He onely nameth himſelf as the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of his regeneration, which he doth not to oppoſe himſelfe to God, but only to ſhew what God doth by the miniſtry of man. Laſtly, when he addeth, [<hi>In my bonds,</hi>] he meaneth, when he was a priſoner, and lay in priſon. This Verſe according to this expoſition of the wordes, is thus much in effect, as if he had ſaid, Hauing thus prepared thee for that which I am to intreate from thy hands, if now thou wouldſt know the party or perſon for whom it is, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is thy runnagate ſeruant <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> and vpon theſe grounds, he is my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſonne, for I haue begotten him in the time of my captiuity, to the true profeſſion and obedience of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obſeruations out of this Verſe.</note> Before wee come to handle the Doctrines and inſtructions ariſing out of this verſe, it ſhall not bee amiſſe to ſet downe diuers profitable obſeruations that may be conſidered. Firſt, we ſee heer a Rhetorical repitition of the ſame word, I beſeech thee being aged and a priſoner, I beſeech thee for my Sonne <hi>Oneſimus.</hi> This redoubling of his prayer, and intreating (vſed alſo <note n="k" place="margin">2 Cor. 10, 1, 2.</note> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) ſheweth the deſire, and manifeſteth the earneſtneſſe of his minde: he was not colde in his ſuite, as if he regarded not whether hee obtained it, but proſecuted it with his whole deſire and full purpoſe, ſo that he contenteth not himſelfe once to beſeech him, but beſeecheth him againe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we ſee, that the perſon of him, whom we will commend to any man, hath great force to moue him, and to preuaile with him, to graunt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs that which we craue and deſire at his handes. Wherefore, whoſoeuer would be commended vnto any, muſt looke to himſelfe that he haue in him ſomewhat woorthy commendation. For, as another mans mouth ſhoulde praiſe vs, &amp; not our own; ſo the matter of praiſe muſt be in our ſelues. A falſe praiſe, is a true diſpraiſe; and a wrongful commending, is a reall diſcommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. The praiſe that commeth from others, muſt proceede from a due de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert in our ſelues. If the Apoſtle had not found a great alteration, he would neuer haue giuen this commendation to <hi>Oneſimus.</hi> Thirdly, we ſee an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in <hi>Paule,</hi> of wonderfull humility, and lowlineſſe of minde. See heer the difference betweene <hi>Paule</hi> the Apoſtle, and the proud Byſhop of <hi>Rome. Paule</hi> beſeecheth where he might command; but he commaundeth where he hath no warrant to beſeech. For the Pope vſurpeth authoritie ouer Princes and Kinges; hee curſſeth and banneth, hee threatneth and thundereth out his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications. It is not ſo with our Apoſtle, for ſuch is his exceeding modeſtie and mildneſſe of Spirit, that he abaſeth himſelfe to bee a falſe and fugitiue ſeruant, whom hee embraceth as his owne Sonne. What coulde bee more reproachfull, then to robbe his Maiſter, and then to play the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagate, that ſo he might runne on in his euill courſe, and deliuer himſelfe from punniſhment? Yet wee ſee, the Apoſtle is not aſhamed of him, is not aſhamed to cal him his Sonne, that <hi>Philemon</hi> might not be aſhamed to receiue and to accept him as his Seruant. For if he be the ſonne of <hi>Paule,</hi> he may bee eſteemed the ſeruant of <hi>Philemon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, wee ſee how effectuall the ſounde conuerſion of a ſinner to God ought to bee, and how forcible it ſhould bee to preuayle with vs, to winne our Loue towardes him, and cauſe vs to performe all the duties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing vnto him. For wee may not bee aſhamed to account him ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a Sonne, or as a Brother, whome GOD accounteth for his owne

But if we marke this aright, we ſhal find the number of thoſe to be few, which regard the Faith, conuerſion, ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; other ſpiritual bleſsings beſtowed vpon their brethren, as they ought, and therefore teſtify no loue, ſhew no ioy, performe no duties, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſinners conuerted vnto God. Fiftly, we ſee that the name and praiſe of a ſpirituall Father (which is proper to God alone) is communicated to the Apoſtles and Miniſters of God: whereas God onely doth renew and regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vs by the power of his ſpirit, the Miniſtry onely is mans, whether hee be Paſtor or Apoſtle. Our Sauior teacheth vs, <note n="l" place="margin">Math. 23, 9.</note> to cal no man Father vpon earth. It is no worke of man (be hee neuer ſo excellent) to frame and reforme the ſoule into the Image of God. But becauſe we are borne anew by Faith, and Faith commeth by hearing, the Miniſter as the diſpoſer of the Myſteries of God, doth vnder God perfourme the dutie of a Father. So then, ſeeing the word of God preached by the mouth and Miniſtery of man, is the immortall ſeede of eternall life, it is no maruell if he bee called by the Title of a Father, from whoſe lippes we conceiue that ſeede, and receiue that worde. Thus much is to be obſerued of vs in general out of this verſe. Now let vs come to the particular Doctrines.</p>

We ſee he vſeth exceeding earneſtneſſe and importunity to haue him receiued to his Maiſters fauor. The condition of <hi>Oneſimus</hi> was this, he was a ſeruant of the baſeſt calling. For men Seruants and Maid-ſeruants in thoſe dayes were not as they be nowe: Men had them not for Wages and hire, as they that wer bound to do no more then Couenant, but they were Bondſlaues, to bee bought and ſold in the Market, and their Maiſters poſſeſſed them as Oxen and Cattle, and hadde power ouer them of life and death. Now, albeit he were a ſeruant of this kind and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and had beene beſides a runnagate and a Theefe, deſeruing greeuous puniſhment, euen death; yet he pleadeth his cauſe being conuerted, with as great force and feruency as can be expreſſed. <note place="margin" type="runSum">

The leaſt &amp; loweſt member that belongeth to God, ought not to be reiected and debaſed, but highly for Chriſts ſake to be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and reſpected.

Likewiſe he embraceth the poore and ſimple, as louingly and cheerefully as the rich and wiſe of the world. The Publicans and ſinners are accepted of him, that were hated of the Iewes. The Woman taken in adultry, accuſed by the Phariſes, is exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him to repentance.

The penitent Theefe hanging <note n="o" place="margin">Luke 23, 43</note> vppon the Croſſe, and hearing Chriſt preach, is conuerted to the Faith, and receiued into paradiſe. It is not the will of <note n="p" place="margin">Mat. 18, 14.</note> our heauenly Father, that one of theſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones ſhould periſh.

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 1.</note> This ſhall not ſeeme any thing ſtrange vnto vs, if we marke the Reaſons whereupon it is grounded. For firſt, thoſe that are leaſt eſteemed, and are of loweſt condition, were bought with as great and high a price as others, and were redeemed not with corruptible things, as Siluer and Gold, but with the deare and precious bloode of Chriſt. Rich and poore, high and lowe, great and ſmall, had all one price paide for their ranſome. This is the reaſon <note n="x" place="margin">Math: 18, 10 11.</note> vrged by Chriſt, <hi>See that ye deſpiſe not one of theſe little ones, for I ſay vnto you, that in Heauen their Angels alwaies behold the face of my Father which is in heauen: for the ſonne of man is come to ſaue that which was lost.</hi> If then, the leaſt be redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by his death, and ſaued by faith in him, as well as the greateſt; it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that al ſhould bee regarded, none contemned; all loued, none deſpiſed.

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 2.</note> Secondly, there is no reſpect of perſons with God. He doth not eſteeme men for accidentall things; as for pouertie, or riches; for honor, or diſhonour. The poore, the fatherleſſe, the widdow, the ſtranger, the ſeruant, are as deare to him, and as greatly reſpected of him, as thoſe that are ſet in high places, &amp; are honoured with great callings. When we ſpeake of a perſon in our talke and communication, me meane ſome man, or ſome woman; but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture meaneth a more ſpeciall thing, to wit; the outward quality or condition of man, which may purchaſe him grace or diſgrace, fauour or disfauor. When God wil cal vs to his truth, and beſtow his graces vppon vs, it is done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his holy wil and good pleaſure; he is not moued to it by the outward appearance and condition of the perſon, he reſpecteth not Country, or ſex, or birth, or riches, or pouertie, or Nobility, or wiſedome, or learning, or friends. This is it which the Apoſtle teacheth, <note n="z" place="margin">Gal. 3, 27, 28</note>

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7222:106"/> there ſhall be the ſame precious felicity. The pooreſt members of Chriſt haue the ſame ſpirituall graces that are neceſſary to ſaluation, and therefore ſhalbe partakers of the ſame inheritance.

                  <hi>Harken my beloued Brethren, hath not GOD choſen the poore of this world, that they ſhould be rich in faith, and heires of the kingdome which he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to them that loue him?</hi> He hath not prepared and prouided one place of glorie for thoſe that are Rich, and another place for thoſe that are poore; he hath not left one inheritance for the Noble, and another for the vnnoble; but as they haue one Faith to apprehend Chriſt, ſo they ſhall haue one glorie to be like vnto Chriſt.

It is a ſound and ſanctified loue that is wrought in vs toward thoſe that are faithfull. The Apoſtle in this place, was ſo farre from beeing aſhamed of <hi>Oneſimus</hi> conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt, and gayned to the Goſpell, though he were a Seruant, and had beene a Theefe and a Runnagate, that he glorieth in his Faith, reioyceth in his Conuerſion, accounteth him as his Sonne, and reſpecteth him as his owne bowelles.

What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the former life of men hath beene, when once they make Conſcience of their waies, beginning to leade an holy life, and to blot out the infamy &amp; reproach of their conuerſation led in the time of their ignorance, it is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to begin to loue them as entirely as our Brethren in Chriſt, and as children with vs of the ſame Father.</p>

We ſee by common and daily experience, when any of our friendes and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars are dead or lye at the point of death, a naturall affection toward them cauſeth vs to weepe and lament for them, and draweth oftentimes from vs abundance of teares; how much more ought it to go neere vs, and make vs ſob and ſigh from the very depth and bottom of our hearts to ſee our brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren lie dead in ſinne, and as it were rotting in the Graue of their corruptions, or elſe to walke in the paths of death that bring with it certaine deſtruction and eternall damnation. If a man ſhould come into a field where he ſhould behold thouſands ſlaine with the ſword, wallowing in their bloud, and others hauing receiued their deaths wound to languiſh in paine and to ſtriue and ſtruggle for life, who would not account it a lamentable ſhew and moſt piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſight? But thus is it with vs, and this is the condition of many thouſands that glory that they abide in health, and yet are moſt dangerouſly ſicke and diſeaſed; that thinke they are aliue, and yet behold they are a company of dead carcaſſes, that boaſt they are farre from the Gates of death, and yet (alaſſe) they lie gaping and gaſping for breath which is ready to be gone? If there be in vs any life of Gods ſpirit, or any loue of Godlineſſe, it cannot but greeue our ſoules to behold the deſolations that are in the earth, <note n="i" place="margin">Reuel 3, 2. 1 Tim 5, 6.

For as a man hauing eſcaped ſhipwracke and got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into an Hauen and Harbour, reioyſeth in his owne ſafety, and comforteth himſelfe in his deliuerance, but when he behouldeth the miſery of his brother ſuffering ſhipwracke and caſt away by the violence of the ſtormes and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtes that beat vpon his barke, which drowne both it and him in the Seas, he cannot but greatly be greeued, and exceedingly perplexed. So ought it to be with vs, howſoeuer the eſcaping from the filthineſſe of the world, and the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of vs with Chriſt our head, doth breed in vs matter of great ioy, and may worthily cauſe vs to reioyce, yet when we ſee the bondage of our bretheren vnder <note n="k" place="margin">1 Pet 2, 19.</note> ſinne, and the ruines into which they are come, it cannot but worke in vs great anguiſh of ſpirit. If we perceiue them to wander out of the way and to go aſtray from the ſimplicity of the Goſpell and from the fold of Chriſt and fellowſhip of the faithfull, it is our part to turne them backe and to gather them home. <hi>For how</hi>

                  <hi>thinke yee?

Firſt, ſuch as are aſhamed of the poore Saintes, who being without the comfort of friendes, but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contempt of the world, are not regarded or eſteemed. He that deſpiſeth his poore brother redeemed with the bloud of Chriſt, would alſo deſpiſe and deſpight Chriſt himſelfe if he walked vpon the earth. He that honoureth not a faithfull man of low degree, doth diſhonour the faith it ſelfe and reprocheth the Goſpell that he profeſſeth; yea, he deſpiſeth the Church, and ſhameth ſuch as are members of it.

Are ye not partiall in your ſelues, and become Iudges of euill thoughts?</hi> The needy ſeruants of God and poore afflicted Saintes are aſhamed and blamed of the world, they are ſcorned and ſcoffed at by the vngodly: ſhall we then, that are of the ſame Religion, profeſſion, and communion, ioyne hand in hand with them, and contemne the faithfull that deſerue to be honoured; thereby adding more ſorrow to their affliction, and doubling the miſery that is vpon them. For it muſt needes lie heauy vpon them and euen oppreſſe them with anguiſh, to finde this meaſure at our handes, of whom they looked for comfort and counſell. This appeareth in the ſaying of the Prophet, <note n="n" place="margin">Pſal 55, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Surely mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my did not defame me, for I could haue borne it, neither did mine aduerſary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt himſelfe againſt me, for I would haue hid me from him, but it was thou (O man) euen my companion, my guide, and my familiar.</hi> It is made a note and marke whereby we may try our ſelues whether we belong to the Church of God, and ſhall be receiued into the Kingdome of glory, <note n="o" place="margin">Pſal 15, 4.</note> that a vile per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is contemned in their eyes, but they honour them that feare the Lord. But the practiſe of many men is directly contrary, who as they are of this world, they magnifie and make much of the vngodly, but tread and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnder their feet the Children of God, as if they were a thing of no value. The Apoſtle blameth the Corinthians, and noteth it as a blot and blemiſh in them, <note n="p" place="margin">1 Cor 11, 22</note> that they put the poore to ſhame, ſeparating themſelues from them, and refuſing to partake the ſupper of the Lord with them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it reproueth ſuch as contemne thoſe that haue once ſinned and fallen into groſſe and greeuous ſinnes, and albeit they be come out of the mire in which they wallowed, and renounce the wickedneſſe in which they walked, yet they alwaies remember them to their reproach, and ſpeake of them to their infamy. But when once their ſinnes become bitter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and they haue giuen good Teſtimony of their vnfaigned repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, we muſt not be vnmercifull and without compaſſion toward them, <note n="q" place="margin">Gal 6, 1, 2.</note> but rather reſtore them with the ſpirit of meekneſſe, conſidering our ſelues, leaſt we alſo be tempted. The former failings in faith or obedience are not to be obiected, or they reiected with reproach after repentance. God remembreth their ſinnes no more, and therefore we ought to forgiue and forget them. They that truely turne vnto God, and repent of their ſinnes from the bottom of their hearts, haue blotted out the ſtaine of it before men, and muſt be eſteemed of vs, as if they had not fallen or offended. For euen as the Prophet teacheth, <note n="r" place="margin">Ezek 18, 21, 24.</note> that if the Righteous turne away from his righteouſneſſe, and commit iniquity, all the righteouſneſſe that hee hath done, ſhall not be mentioned, but in the tranſgreſſion that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and in the ſinne that he hath ſinned, in them he ſhall die: ſo if the wicked ſhall returne from all his ſinnes that he hath committed, and keepe all the ſtatutes of God, and do that which is lawfull and right, he ſhall ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly liue and ſhall not die, all his tranſgreſſions that he hath committed, they ſhall not be mentioned vnto him, but in his righteouſneſſe that he hath done he ſhall liue. Sinne indeed bringeth a wound with it, but when once repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance commeth, the wound is cured, and the ſcarre is healed, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of it is aboliſhed, for God will blot it out of his booke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</p>

This corrupt opinion and deceitfull iudgement is reproued by the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> in his Epiſtle <note n="ſ" place="margin">Iam 2, 1.</note> Chap. 2. <hi>My bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren haue not the faith of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt in reſpect of perſons.</hi> Where he teacheth, that the profeſſion of the faith ought to be eſteemed with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle eye and a ſimple affection, and that partiall affection of one before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is to be auoided. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> But may we not preferre one before another, and is it vnlawfull to haue reſpect of degrees among men? may I not honour a wicked man with honour due to him, and ſet vp the vngodly in higher place aboue the Godly? <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> yes, in outward reſpects euery one is to be aduanced and reuerenced according to his calling without reſpect of his Godlineſſe or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe; of his Religion or ſuperſtition; of his faith or infidelity. For to whomſoeuer God hath giuen preheminence, it is our duty to yeeld them obedience. A wicked father is to be honoured no leſſe then a Godly, an hard Maiſter is to be feared no leſſe then a gentle, a wicked Prince is to be ſerued no leſſe then a faithfull. It is Gods Ordinance that hath lifted them vp aboue others. The purpoſe of the Apoſtle is not to take away, no not from euill men their externall dignity, or to draw others to deny them duty, but his meaning is, that we ought not to meaſure the ſoundneſſe of faith, or the truth of Religion, by outward prerogatiues, or to conclude that ſuch haue a right profeſſion and true beleefe, becauſe they haue Riches, and are men of authority; and the faith of others contemned, becauſe they are poore in goodes, few in number, weake in ſtrength, low in degree, baſe in birth, and meane in all outward thinges, which are greatly accounted off in the world. This reproueth ſuch as ſtand vpon mens outward perſons, and make the quallity and condition of the outward appearance a rule to try and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their faith and Religion. Theſe are ſuch as build vpon the Sand, and ſet their houſe vpon a ſlight and ſlender foundation, which is ſoone ſhaken and ſuddainly falleth to the ground. Theſe are ſuch as meaſure the matters of faith by the deceitfull line of mens perſons. Hence it is, that if a man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade his brother that he houldeth an errour, and moue him to embrace the truth, though he be conuinced by the Teſtimony of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, yet he will readily reply and anſweare; you are not learned, you are no Scholler, you haue not beene at the Vniuerſity, other great men are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind, who are before you in age, aboue you in knowledge, and beyond you in iudgement. Exhort a man in theſe daies to heare the word with all dilligence, and to attend vnto it with all carefulneſſe, as to the Ordinance of God, and the ordinary meanes to worke in vs ſaluation, <note n="t" place="margin">Iohn 8.</note> tell him that he that is of God muſt heare Gods word, <note n="u" place="margin">Iam 1, 19.</note> ſhew him that euery man ſhould be ſwift to heare, ſlow to ſpeake, and ſlow to wrath, <note n="x" place="margin">1 Pet 2, 2.</note> conuince his conſcience that he muſt deſire the ſincere milke of the word that he might grow thereby, he is wiſe in his owne conceit to ſhift off all theſe inſtructions, and to deceiue himſelfe: ſaying, If this were ſo needfull and neceſſary a duty, we ſhould not haue ſo many great men, and rich men, neglect the word: They like not this ſo much preaching and preciſeneſſe, we ſee ſuch are great Clearks and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Diuines do preach ſeldome, ſome once or twice a yeare, others once a moneth, why cannot we be content to follow them?

So then, <hi>Paul</hi> ſo giueth himſelfe the name of Father, as that he neither robbeth God, nor taketh from him the leaſt iot of the honor that is due to his name. For it is a common rule, that they are not contrary, which are ſubordinate. When one is vnder another, and inferiorly ordered &amp; ordained to another, there is a good agreement betweene them.

So there ſeemeth a contradiction betweene <hi>Paule</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> in the matters of Faith and Good-works, <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 3, 20. Iames 2, 24. Gal. 2, 16.</note>

The Reaſon why they vſe a different order of teaching, is the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:7222:110"/> diuerſity of the Schollers, which they inſtructed, and the contrary affection of ſuch as they taught and informed. <hi>Paule</hi> had to do with Iuſticiaries that ſought to be iuſtified partly by faith, and partly by works; partly by Chriſt, &amp; partly by themſelues; partly by ſomwhat in another, and partly by ſomwhat in themſelues; partly by the merits of another, and partly by their own ſtrength and merits. <hi>Iames</hi> had not to do with ſuch perſons, but with Libertines and looſe liuers, which confeſſed in wordes free Iuſtification thorough Faith in Chriſt, yet they were deceiued and had not learned, that all thoſe that are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifyed, are alſo ſanctified, that all that are in Chriſt, are become newe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that they are borne anew, and walke not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit, and therefore thought workes needleſſe and fruitleſſe. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> dealt in this place. If at any time he ſaw ſo much honour giuen to the Miniſters, as that Gods honour was diminiſhed, or any way obſcured, and ſo hee robbed of his glory; then hee pulled downe their eſtimation, that God might haue his right, and be vnto vs all in all. But if on the other ſide, they were deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and diſgraced (as in theſe dayes they are) whereby the word alſo was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred, and God, the Author of it, and the ordainer of them diſhonoured; they ought to haue their due, they are to magnify their office, and to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as the Miniſters of Chriſt. As for example, when we haue to deale either with the Anabaptiſts, that wait for reuelations, and vtterly reiect the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry &amp; Miniſters of the worde, or with thoſe prophane Atheiſts of our time, who contemn them, and count them idle and of no vſe, and ſo haue no regard of them, or reſpect vnto them: wee are to ſhew in what an high calling God hath ſeated them. He ſaith of them, <note n="d" place="margin">Math. 10, 20</note> 
                  <hi>It is not you that ſpeake, but the ſpirite in you.</hi> He ſaith of them, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me.</hi> He ſaith of them, <hi>Whoſe ſinnes ye remit, they are remitted; &amp; whoſe ſinnes ye retaine, they are retained.</hi> This ſerueth to ſtop the mouthes of carnall men, and alloweth vs to know our ſelues, when the worlde will not know vs, or acknowledge vs. But when we haue to deale with thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who make their Pope a God on earth, and ſet their Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and Clergy aboue the word, we are to be taught what the Miniſtry is of it ſelf, being ſeparated from the ſpirit of God; an empty ſound without force, and a bare Inſtrument without effect in the hand of the workeman, that can do nothing of it ſelfe, but as it is vſed and applied by the worke-man. Thus much of the remoouing of ſuch Obiections, as might hinder the vſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of this Doctrine.</p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</note> Now let vs come to conſider the Vſes, which are either general, belonging ioyntly both to the Paſtors &amp; people; or ſpecial, belonging to either of them. Firſt, ſeeing the Miniſter and people ought to loue as Father and Sonne, it teacheth them to cut off all occaſions of diſcord and diuiſion, and to nouriſh loue and mutuall concorde one with another. It may bee many occaſions may ariſe, which if by wiſedome they be not ſmothered and ſuppreſſed in the beginning, they are as little ſparkes that quickly break out into a flame, and the flame ſuffered to continue conſumeth al things that are neere vnto it. We muſt ſhew our ſelues ready to bring water to quench this fire. We muſt ſtop the Flood-gates, that the ſtreames of contention doo not ouer-flow, and in the end drowne vs as in the deepe waters. It is a deceitfull ſnare, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull ſubtilty of Satan, to caſt matters of diſſention betweene the Miniſter and people (as it were a bone to gnaw vpon) that ſo though the word bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, yet that it may by that meanes be with leſſe fruit and profit with them. Well doth this enemy of mankind know, that where there is hatred to the perſon, there can be no loue to his preaching: and where there is deſire of contention, there can be no hope of edification. For whome the people hate, they regard not to heare; and where there is no liking to the man, there will follow a loathing of his Miniſtry. We ſee this in the example of <hi>Ahab</hi>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:7222:110"/> toward <hi>Eliah</hi> and <hi>Micaiah,</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">1 Kin. 21, 19 20. &amp; 22, 7, 8.</note> whom he hated to the death, and profeſſeth his enmity toward them, and therefore deſpiſed the word that came from their mouths. When <hi>Eliah</hi> reproued him for killing of <hi>Naboth,</hi> and taking poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Vineyard, he ſaide, <hi>Haſt thou found me, O mine enemy?</hi> So when <hi>Iehoſhaphat</hi> asked, if there were not a Prophet of the Lord that they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of him, <hi>Ahab</hi> who had ſold himſelfe to worke wickedneſſe in the ſight of the Lord, aunſwered; <hi>There is yet one man, Michaiah the Sonne of Imlah, by whom we may aske counſell of the Lord, but I hate him, for hee dooth not propheſie good vnto me, but euill.</hi> Where we ſee, he hated the Prophet, and therfore ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred his propheſie, and regarded not to haue him in his preſence. We may behold this in the example of the Scribes and Phariſees toward <hi>Paule,</hi> they could not abide him nor his doctrine, ſo that he was employed principally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles. On the other ſide, as the people loue the Miniſters from the heart, ſo for the moſt part they profit by them. The Apoſtle giueth this Teſtimony of the <hi>Galathians,</hi> that they loued him exceedingly, and therefore regarded his Doctrine accordingly, <note n="f" place="margin">Gal. 4, 14, 15</note> 
                  <hi>The triall of me which was in my fleſh ye deſpiſed not, neither abhorred; but ye receiued me as an Angell of GOD, yea, as Chriſt Ieſus: what was then your felicity? For I beare ye record, that if it had bin poſsible, ye would haue plucked out your owne eyes, and haue giuen them vnto mee.</hi> Hence it is, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles labour to plant this truth, and to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle this perſwaſion in the hearts of thoſe whome they taught, that they vvere dearely beloued to them. When the Diſciples were afraid at Chriſts words, he anſwered again &amp; ſaid vnto them, <note n="g" place="margin">Mark 10, 24</note> 
                  <hi>Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches, to enter into the kingdome of God.</hi> So the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaketh, <note n="h" place="margin">Eſay 8, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I and the children whom the Lord hath giuen mee, are as ſignes and as won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus do the Apoſtles write in this manner to the Churches, calling them beloued brethren, and deare children. As we haue louing words in our mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, ſo we ſhould haue louing affections in our hearts. It is a pittiful ſight, &amp; lamentable condition, when the Paſtor in any place ſetteth himſelfe againſt the people, and the people againſt the Paſtor; when they that ſhould loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as Father and Son, do wrangle together as Cats and Dogs, and are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſnarling and byting one of another. If a priuate houſe be diuided againſt it ſelfe, it cannot ſtand; ſo, if a particular Church, be in a bitter mutiny, it run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to ruine, and is miſerably torn in peeces. It is a great praiſe of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, where they are at peace and vnity, ioyne together in the word &amp; Sacraments, and ſing the Pſalmes and ſongs of God, to his endleſſe praiſe. It is a comfortable thing, when the people reioyce in their Miniſter, &amp; the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in his people: when the people deſire and delight in the companie of their Miniſter, and the Miniſter in the company of his people, and ſo take comfort in the ſweet ſociety one of another. This reproueth thoſe, that vpon euery ſlight occaſion, for euery ſlender profit, yea for euery toy &amp; trifle, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſuits of Law, and bring actions of treſpaſſe one againſt another, whereby they trouble not onely their neighbours at home, but the Countrey abroad. Theſe haue forgotten the words of <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Lot,</hi> when a debate aroſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their Heard-men, <note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 13, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Let there be no ſtrife, I pray thee, betweene thee &amp; me, neither betweene mine Heard-men, and thine Heard-men, for wee are Bretheren.</hi> It is therefore a great ſhame and reproach to heare of ſuch iarres and ciuill wars as are in many pariſhes. It is a plaine argument that there is little loue betweene them, and leſſe good wrought among them. The Miniſter accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them not as his Sonnes and Daughters, he ſeeketh not to winne them to the faith, he eſteemeth them not as his Crown in the day of the Lord. On the other ſide, the people do not reuerence their Miniſter as their father, but hate him as their enemy. God is not among ſuch Miniſters and people, but is gon farre from them, and they are departed farre from him. <hi>God is</hi>

Wherefore, to return thither from whence we began, we muſt remember the amiable names giuen to the Paſtor and people, they muſt conſider they are as Father and Son, neerely coupled and ioyned together, and thereby ſtirre vppe themſelues, and admoniſh one another of their duties, to open their hearts in loue, and againe to ſhut them vp, that hatred haue no entrance into them, hnd that mallice do not abide in them.</p>

Great is the loue of Parents towardes their Children. If the Childe be ſicke or wayward, they doe not caſt him out of doores, or withdraw their affections from him. Hence it is, that Chriſt when he ſaw the people ſcattered abroad, and diſperſed heere and there as Sheepe without a Shepheard, <note n="d" place="margin">Math. 9 36.</note> 
                  <hi>He had compaſſion vpon them, and ſhewed great loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them.</hi> We ſee how Chriſt applyeth this to the Conſcience of <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp; <note n="e" place="margin">Iohn 21, 15, 16.</note> willeth him to try his loue toward him, by feeding his Sheepe and Lambes, thereby aſſuring him, that if he perſwaded himſelfe to loue Chriſt Ieſus, and yet was not carefull to teach his people, he deceiued himſelfe, and lyed to the Holy-Ghoſt, who would finde him out in his ſinne. This ſerueth to reproue ſundry corruptions, and to meete with many abuſes in the Miniſters, that make them vnworthy of the name of Fathers, and teſtifie that their hearts are empty of this vnfaigned loue, that ought to bee in them towards Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whom they ſhould affect as deare Children.

The Scriptures of the olde and new Teſtament, do directly forbid it. The Lord ſaith by his Prophet Eſay, <note n="h" place="margin">Eſay 61, 6. Ezek. 44, 8. Zac. 11, 16, 17</note>

                  <hi>To obey them that haue the ouer-ſight of them, and ſubmit themſelues, for they watch for their Soules, as they that muſt giue accounts.</hi> It is a great wonder, that negligent Paſtors reading theſe places, and conſidering theſe charges laid vpon their ſhoulders, can ſo eaſily ſhake them off, or ſo ſlightly paſſe them ouer, or ſo ſoone for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get them. They may ſeeme more then ſufficient to conuince them of want of loue, of abundance of couetouſneſſe, of exceſſe of idleneſſe, of hardneſſe of heart, of contempt of the word, which they ſhould teach to others. A great and heauy iudgement of God is vpon them, that can paſſe ouer this duty without feare and trembling, that can ſee neyther the daunger of their owne ſoules, nor the danger of the peoples Soules through want of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Againe, the Titles giuen to the Miniſters vnder the Goſpell, as alſo to the Prophets and Prieſtes vnder the Law, doe vrge diligence, faithfulneſſe, and carefull attendance; and conſequently, the perſonall preſence of the Paſtor. They are called, <note n="q" place="margin">Ephe. 4, 11.</note> Shepheards, <note n="r" place="margin">Ezek. 33.</note> Watch-men, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Luke 12, 42.</note> Stewards, <note n="t" place="margin">Heb. 13, 17.</note> Captains, <note n="u" place="margin">1 Cor. 3, 9.</note> Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <note n="x" place="margin">2 Cor. 5, 12.</note> Embaſſadours, and ſuch like; ſo that, though they teach oftentimes by themſelues, and continually and conſtantly by others, they are not excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. The office of the Miniſter is ſet forth in the Picture of a Shepheard, who, by reaſon of the multitude of rauenous Wolus &amp; other hurtfull Beaſts, keepeth watch day and night ouer his flocke. He is a Watch-man ſet in his Watch-Tower to diſcry the enemy, and to giue warning of the danger. He is a Steward to prouide for the Family, and to giue them their portion of meat in due ſeaſon. He is a Captaine of the Lords Hoaſt, to lead them into the obedience of godlineſſe, and to goe before them in example of life. He is a Builder, to frame them and fit them to be ſtones in the Lordes building. He is an Ambaſſadour, to deliuer the will of him that ſent him, and to ſpeak being called, as the words of God. Theſe compariſons, as they ſerue to teach diligence and continuance in preaching, ſo they are forcible to preſſe him to attend vpon his charge, that attendeth vpon him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the office of the Miniſter, ſaith; <note n="y" place="margin">2 Cor. 2, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe thinges?</hi> When he hath done all he can, and imployed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the vtmoſt of his power, yet he ſhall come farre ſhort of his duty: how much more, when hee is ordinarily abſent from his charge, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth his ordinary preſence?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is againſt the order of Nature, the rule of reaſon, and the law of Iuſtice, to take wages for that worke which he doth not performe; and to eate where he doth not labour. It is a great wrong and iniury done to thoſe that labour in feeding the Flocke, to bee denyed to eate of the Milke of the Flocke: to do the ſeruice, and another to receiue the reward: to take the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7222:112"/> Corne, and to giue others the Straw: to ſow ſpirituall things, and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of temporall thinges: to beare the burden, and to endure the heate of the day, and other to come and take away the penny and price for which they couenanted. It is a kind of theft to eate without labour, and to feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues without taking paines.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, the danger is very great, that groweth both to the Paſtors and people, by this ſin of abſence and want of attendance. For if any of the Soules which belong vnto their charge doe perriſh through their negligence, and ſtarue through want of foode, they ſhall be arraigned as guilty of their death and deſtruction. The Prophet <hi>Ezekell</hi> ſetteth downe the threatning of God, <note n="z" place="margin">Ezek. 33, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>When I ſhall ſay vnto the wicked!

And when the Paſtor is abſent, the people wil ſoone decline, from zeale to coldneſſe, fall from vertue to vice, turne from the worſhip of God to Idolatry, reuolt from the workes of piety, to damnable ſecurity. Let a man with-hold his hand, and ceaſe from ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good ſeede, or vnder-ſow his ground by ſparing his Corne, Thiſtles and Weedes will ſpring vp in ſtead thereof. Let a man haue food withdrawne from him, and abſtaine from nouriſhment that feedeth the body, he ſhall be filled with winde, and fall into weakneſſe.

When the Shepheard is gone, the Wolues may ſafely enter into the Sheepefold, not ſparing the Flocke. When the Watch-man is gone or fallen aſleepe, the Enemy may enter and ſacke the Citty. When the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman that ſowed good ſeede in his fielde is departed, <note n="f" place="margin">Math. 13 25</note> the enuious man came and ſowed Cockle and Darnell among the Corne. While the people haue the preſence and reſidence of their faithfull Paſtor to feede them, and to goe in and out before them, both in Doctrin and example, yet ſuch is the weakneſſe of Fleſh, the corruption of Nature, the ſtrength of ſin, the ſubtilty of the Enemy, the vanity of the world, the vnconſtancy of humane thinges, that they are ready to fall and to giue ouer; albeit I ſay that he be with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and conuerſant among them, and remain in the midſt of them? If then much euill be done while the Ouer-ſeers are preſent, much more will be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted while they are abſent, while there is none to ſtay them, while the Bridle is caſt in their owne neckes.

               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, the neceſſity of hauing the preſence of the Paſtour continually to call vpon the people, appeareth heerein, becauſe the danger of the Wolfe is
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7222:112"/> continuall, and therefore the vſe of the Shepheard is continuall. The Apoſtle telleth the Elders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi>

Now, the more diligent the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall enemy is, the more violent and watchfull ought the Paſtour to be. If the good man of the Houſe knew at what houre the Theefe would come to rob and to ſteale, doubtleſſe he would watch, and not ſuffer his houſe to bee broken downe. Hence it is that <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith; <hi>Be ſober and watch,</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">1 Pet. 5, 8</note> 
                  <hi>for your aduerſary the Deuill as a roaring Lyon, walketh about ſeeking whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.</hi> And ſurely this is the cauſe, that in ſome places the people are defiled with all abhominations; in other places they are peruerted and ſeduced by Ieſuits and Seminary Prieſts, and in all places grow cold and careleſſe in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, becauſe they want meanes to guide them and ſtay them in the right way, they haue not zealous Paſtours to ſtirre them vp to godlineſſe, and to driue away the Wolfe farre from them.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, it is of euill report, a note of couetouſneſſe, or euill ſuſpicion of it, and giueth great offence to the Church of God. For where there is an vnneceſſary abſence of the Miniſter from his cure and charge, hee giueth occaſion to ſuſpect, that he rather deſireth to feed vpon them, then to feed them: to ſeeke theirs, then them: to prey vppon them, then to pray with them: to poſſeſſe their goods, then to win their Soules. We are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to abſtaine from all appearance of euill. And the Apoſtle approoueth his Miniſtery to the conſciences of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> by this, <note n="k" place="margin">2 Cor. 12, 14</note> 
                  <hi>That hee ſought not theirs, but them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eightly, the inconuenience is great that commeth by this abſence, it is the cauſe of a Vagrant, in-ſufficient, idle, and reproachfull Miniſtery, and an euident occaſion of keeping out of ſufficient men and able Work-men, both able and apt to teach, and of impoueriſhing ſuch as are already entred. This is the cauſe of many wandring Leuites, and of ſundry that ſit idle for want of imployment.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, this ordinary abſence is againſt the Statutes of Princes, and the decrees of Counſels, holden not onely in the moſt pure times, but in the moſt palpable times, euen as it were at midnight, when the whole earth was ouer-ſhaddowed with darkneſſe.

If any be called to another charge, let him ſimply giue ouer the former, and claime no intereſt in it.

               <p>Hitherto we haue ſhewed the neceſſity of the Paſtours preſence, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened the reaſons whereby it is confirmed and ſtrengthned.

The cauſes that are pretended to excuſe and defend the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours abſence, are taken partly from the holy Scripture, and partly from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reaſon. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection 1.</note> Firſt, they ſay it was lawfull and lawfully practiſed in <hi>Epaphras,</hi> who was the Miniſter of the <hi>Coloſſians;</hi> yea, a faithfull Miniſter, yet abſent from that Church. <hi>Col.</hi> 1, 7. and 4, 12.

                  <note n="n" place="margin">Col. 4.</note> was the Paſtour of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> who is charged to looke to his Miniſtery that he had receiued in the Lord, that he fulfill it.

                  <hi>Paul</hi> did, or to practiſe ſome other laudable ſcience, which will be without offence to God or Man.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection 3</note> It is in his power to roote vp, that did plant: it belongeth to him to pull downe, that did build: he can deſtroy, that doth preſerue.

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> I aunſwere, that Magiſtrates may not abrogate and aboliſh Lawes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and conformed according to Gods Lawes. Againe, the diuiſion of Pariſhes is not from men, but of God. For when the Scripture <note n="r" place="margin">Act. 24, 23, &amp; Tit. 1, 5. and 1 Cor. 12, 40.</note> willeth Elders to bee choſen for euery Church, and that theſe aſſemblies ſhould bee with the greateſt conuenience of order and comelineſſe; it is plaine, that thereby is preſcribed, a diuiſion of nationall Churches into particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. For this cauſe <hi>Paule</hi> left <hi>Titus</hi> in <hi>Creta,</hi> that he ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to redreſſe the thinges that remaine, and ſhould ordaine Elders in euery Citty. So the Apoſtles ordained Elders by election in euery Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection 4.</note> Againe, it may be ſaid, a man may haue two Liuings, being by Law vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Therefore before they be vnited. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> I anſwer, if the vnion bee ſuch, that there may bee but one body, and one competent and commodious reſort thereof together in one place, ſo as one Paſtour may fitly inſtruct them, and lead them out and in, in the duties of Religion, in the ſanctification of the Sabbaoth, in the practiſe of holineſſe, and in example of life: then it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that albeit it be lawfull to make this coniunction, yet it is not proued lawfull before the vnion.

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7222:113" rendition="simple:additions"/> in queſtion. And where as according to our diuiſion of Pariſhes, lands, are occupyed by Forrainers and Strangers; and conſequently, Tithes and duties taken of them, without any feeding of them, it was ordained to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a certaine, knowne, and definite maintenance, and beſides the Miniſter not failing in his calling, they may be partakers of his labour.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection 6.</note> Furthermore, it is obiected, that Paſtors are not tied to particular places, but are diſcharged by a generall teaching. It skilleth not where they teach, ſo they be not idle. They are Miniſters of the Church of England, and therefore may preach in any part of the Land, and are blameleſſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no vnlawfull non-reſidency. For God hath ordained (ſaith the <note n="ſ" place="margin">1 Cor. 9, 14</note> Apoſtle) <hi>That they which Preach the Gospell, may liue of the Gospell.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> I anſwer, they are not onely Miniſters of England, but of ſuch a particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and haue their maintenance of ſuch a particular Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are bound to imploy their labour in that particular place. He that hath not a particular charge and Church to care for, will care indeede for no Church as he ought to care. For if that which is <note n="t" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ariſt polit. lib.</hi> 2.</note> cared for of all, is cared for of none: then he that hath but a generall care, of one place no more then of another, commonly neglecteth all. When God ſent <hi>Ionah</hi> the Prophet to <hi>Niniue,</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Ion. 1, 2, 3.</note> he ſinned in going to <hi>Tarſhiſh.</hi> If he had preached neuer ſo duely and diligently in that Citty, when God called him to another, he had not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the duty of a good Prophet. Beſides, whereas they ſay they are Miniſters of England, &amp; therefore ſufficeth to preach in any corner or quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Land: they may as well ſay they are Miniſters of <hi>Europe,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently may preach in any part of <hi>Europe,</hi> and be diſcharged in conſcience of any farther duty to be required of them. Nay, ſome are ſo ſhameleſſe, as they dare openly auouch, that they are as much bound to the Church of Ieruſalem, if they might haue acceſſe thereunto, as to that people that called them, and doe maintaine them. Verily, this argueth little learning, and leſſe conſcience. For this were to change a Paſtor into an Apoſtle, a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted office into an vnlimited, and as great a wonder as to bring all the world into the circuit and compaſſe of a little Towne. And we ſee it is directlie againſt the order of the Scripture, which calleth them Miniſters of ſuch and ſuch a particular Church; <note n="x" place="margin">Acts 20, 17. Phil. 1, 1. Reue. 2, &amp; 3.</note> as of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> of <hi>Sardi,</hi> and the reſt. So when generall teaching <note n="y" place="margin">Math. 28, 20</note> is Apoſtolicall, particular is <note n="z" place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 2. Heb. 13, 17.</note> Paſtorall, which is limited to a certaine place. Againe, it is a thing in it ſelfe vnreaſonable, and to the people iniurious, that they ſhoulde receiue their Wages in one place, and performe their ſeruice in another place: that one ſhould giue them their hire, and another haue the profit of their paines. Would not a man thinke he had wrong done him, if he hyring a ſeruant, another ſhoulde take the labour of his hands? Or ſhould that ſeruant be excuſed, who hauing wages paid him by his Maiſter, ſhould apply himſelfe in another mans work? Or, when a man hireth a ſhepheard to looke to his ſheepe, will hee not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine if they be neglected, and another mans ſheepe fed and attended? Or, can ſuch a ſhepheard thinke his duty diſcharged, albeit he be neuer ſo diligent and watching in looking to the ſheepe of another? A Shepheard hath a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Flocke to attend, which hee muſt watch: a Seruant muſt diſpatch his worke that hath hired him. Thus it ought to be with euery faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, he hath his ſpeciall ground to Till, his proper houſe to build, his Flocke to feede, his Citty to watch, his Army to lead, and may not wander out of the boundes and borders limited vnto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection 7</note> Others alledge in excuſe of this abſence, that many of them giue neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry attendance vpon their Lords and their Families, and being their Houſhold Chaplaines, and ſo doing ſeruice to great perſons, are forced to bee abſent from their Cures. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> I anſwere, this ſauoureth of couetouſneſſe, or of ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or rather of both. They haue couetous hearts, and aſpiring mindes. If
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:7222:114"/> they haue peculiar charges of their owne, Who compelled them to be other mens Chaplaines? Or if they be to attend vpon their Lords, who compelled them to take the charge of Soules? It was an vſuall thing among the godlie Kinges of <hi>Iudah,</hi> to haue their Prophets at their elbowes to teach them, to ſtirre them vp to good thinges, and to keepe them from falling into ſinne. The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> had <hi>Gad</hi> the <hi>Seer</hi> belonging vnto him, <note n="a" place="margin">1 Sam. 22, 5 2 Sam. 24, 11</note> who was with him in his baniſhment, and was as his Counſellour, he was retained both in proſperity and aduerſity with him. And it is a commendable thing, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Princes, but in men of State and high place, when they entertaine ſuch for a loue of the truth, to inſtruct them and their families in the knowledge of godlineſſe: when they eſteeme them as the Miniſters of God, and giue them (not ſingle, but) that double honour which Gods word alloweth them: and when they can be content to heare the Law at their mouthes, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelues to the obedience of that which is ſpoken vnto them in the Name of the Lord. Yea, ſuch as are ſo entertained, may highly aduance Gods glory, and doe great good with ſuch great men, and in ſuch great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, if they regard to doe good ſeruice to God, rather then to themſelues; if they doe not flatter to pleaſe men, but deale carefully and conſcionably in their places. But ſuch as are of high calling, may haue attendance and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſeruice done vnto them by others, that are without Cures, and haue no charge of ſoules committed vnto them: and as they are willing to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them, ſo they are able to maintaine them, that they ſhall not liue of the Churches which they doe not inſtruct.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection 8.</note> Laſtly, they pretend that they teach commonly by themſelues, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually by their ſubſtitutes. They come often among their people, and teach them by Curates which they haue ſet in their places: and therefore they ſinne not by <hi>Non-reſidency.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> I aunſwer, this often teaching is not ſufficient, where continuall watchfulneſſe is required. The Lord neuer ſaid vnto him [<hi>Teach often:</hi>] but preach the word in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon. <hi>He is accurſed that doth the worke of the Lord negligently. Iere.</hi> 48, 10. Diligence is required, where danger is feared. The flockes that are in danger of the Wolfe, <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 31, 40 Luke 2, 8. Eſay 62. 6.</note> are watched day and night. The Enemy is alwayes at hand, and watcheth his aduantage by the abſence of the Paſtour. If they could couenant and agree with the aduerſary, neuer to aſſault their charges, but at cettaine times and ſeaſons of the yeare, and bargaine with him not to meddle in their abſence, they had ſome good pretence for their negligence, and might bee ready to meete him when he commeth to tempt and ſeduce their people.</p>
               <p>Againe, they cannot bee diſcharged by a Deputy, where they are to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme perſonall duty: neyther are they freed from blame by other mens guifts, where they are to practiſe their owne guifts. Theſe are like to the Prieſtes, <note n="c" place="margin">Num. 7, 9. &amp; 2 Sam. 6, 3.</note> who beeing commaunded to beare the Arke vppon their owne Shoulders, did ſet it vpon a Cart, and draw it with Oxen.

Chriſt Ieſus is the Shepheard, <note n="f" place="margin">1 Pet. 5, 4.</note> the cheefe and great Shepheard of the Sheepe, all other Paſtours are but his Seruants and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7222:114"/> Subſtitutes: and therefore themſelues being his Deputies, they cannot make a Deputy, no more then one Seruant diſcharge himſelfe by another. So then, we muſt know, that they can no more be ſaide to preach the Word, that preach by others; then to be reſident, that are reſident by others: or to bee godly that lead a godly life by others; and thus they may be ſaued by others, and themſelues goe to Hell. But as euery man is bound to liue godly him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſo is euery Paſtour bound to preach in his owne perſon. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth vnder the compariſons and ſimilitudes of Builders, Captaines, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, Stewards, and Shepheards, which wee ſpake of before. When a man hath made choyce of a skilfull and cunning Builder to build his houſe, the Worke-man hath not done his duty, if he put it out to bee finiſhed by another. When a Prince hath made choyce of a Generall to lead his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt the Enemy, he may not ſend another in his roome, and himſelfe ſit idle at home, but his alleageance bindeth him to goe in his owne perſon. The like we might ſay of the reſt. Thus we haue ſeene at large, that the loue betweene the Paſtour and people ouerthroweth the ordinary abſence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iuſt and conſcionable cauſes the one from the other, ſo that if the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter would aſſure his owne heart that he loueth the ſheepe which he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vpon him to teach, he muſt ſhew it by feeding them with the wholeſome and heauenly paſtures of the word of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it reprooueth ſuch as outwardly are in ſheepes cloathing, but inwardly are rauening Wolues vnto the Flocke; not carefull Paſtours, not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Parents, but ſuch as haue no prouiſion, no ſtore, no food, no Bread of Life to breake vnto them, but ſeeke to ſtarue and famiſh them through want of Milke and meat to put in their mouthes. If they be reſident and remaine with them, and yet doe not inſtruct them, and preach vnto them, it is all one as if they were abſent from them. If there be meat and drinke in the houſe, and none ſet vpon the Table or giuen to the Children, they may dye and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for hunger.</p>
               <p>Theſe idle Drones are no better then Murtherers and Man-ſlayers; nay, Soule-ſlayers, which is the greateſt and moſt bloody Murther. For as the Steward that ſhould feede the bodies of ſuch as are in the Family, and pineth them to death, is a Murtherer: and the Nurſe, that vndertaketh the nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of the Childe, and yet eyther through daintineſſe or idleneſſe, or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, will not draw out the breaſt, but ſuffereth the Child to languiſh and periſh, is a Murtherer of the Childe: ſo ſuch as are Stewards of Gods houſe, and Nurſes of Gods people, yet feede not their Soules, but ſtarue them to death, are Bloud-ſuckers and Murtherers in the higheſt degree. They are worſe then the Canibals that liue vpon bloud: for theſe liue vpon the ſoules of men, and carry them head-long to Hell. The Lord complaineth in the Prophet, <note n="g" place="margin">Hoſ. 4, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>That the people periſh through want of knowledge.</hi> Such as are blindely led, doe fall into the Ditch with their blind Leaders. The bloud of ſuch as periſh in their ignorance through want of teaching, <note n="h" place="margin">Ezek. 3, 18.</note> ſhall be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at the Watch-mans hand. The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> hauing the Water of the well of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> (that he longed and luſted to taſt) brought vnto him, <note n="i" place="margin">2 Sam. 23, 17</note> yet would not drinke thereof when he had it, but poured it for an offering vnto the Lord, becauſe it was the bloud of the men that went in ieopardy of their liues. O that theſe men would conſider of their ſinne, and had a feeling of their iniquity, that they eate and drinke the bloud of Men, and maintaine themſelues by the deſtruction of their ſoules. Suppoſe he lead an vnblameable life, giue good example to others, keepe hoſpitality, fill their bellies, make peace among his Neighbours, be able priuately to exhort and comfort them, and to performe other common workes of Charity: yet he hath not diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the duty of a Miniſter, vnleſſe he preach vnto them diligently and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and diuide the word of truth aright.</p>

Nay, we ſhould account of them (if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) more then of naturall Parents. Of our Parents wee haue receiued onely to be; Of our Miniſters we haue receiued to be well.

               <p>The fift Commaundement calleth and comprehendeth, all Paſtours vnder the Name of Parents, to teach vs to know thoſe that haue begotten vs vnto the Lorde, and to note the time, the meanes, and the perſon that hath brought that bleſſing vpon vs. It hath beene an old and ancient cuſtome, for men to celebrate their birth-day, <note n="n" place="margin">Math. 14, 6.</note> as we ſee in <hi>Herod,</hi> who vſually made a great Feaſt at it: much more oughteſt thou to make thy New-birth day, wherein thou was borne againe and made the Childe of God, a day of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity neuer to be forgotten, and to reioyce therein aboue all thinges and times in the World. This reprooueth thoſe, that regard not to heare them, nor care to attend to their Doctrine. For as God condemneth the abſence of the Paſtour from his owne people; ſo he reprooueth the abſence of the people from their owne Paſtour. Some hold of <hi>Paule,</hi> ſome of <hi>Cephas,</hi> ſome of <hi>Apollos,</hi> and delight more in the guifts of a Straunger, then in the Miniſterie of him whom the Lord hath placed ouer them. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> But may wee heare none but our owne Paſtours?

I am no Patron of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaching Prelats, I wiſh them eyther reformed, or remooued: eyther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended or depriued. If a man want foode at home, he may lawfully aske Bread and take releefe abroad: but when a man is plentifully ſtored, or at leaſt, competently and conueniently prouided for at home, it is a ſhame to take the Bread that is appointed for others. Be it that other Paſtours haue greater guiftes of learning, of zeale, of vtterance, then our owne: yet wee are bound to heare them, to pray for them, to attend vpon them, as they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend vpon vs. He hath commanded euery <note n="o" place="margin">Prou. 5, 15.</note> Man to eate his owne Bread, and to drinke the Water of his owne Ceſterne, contenting himſelfe with his own eſtate, not enuying the better eſtate of another.</p>
               <p>Wee ſee how mercifully the Lord dealeth with thoſe of the lower and poorer ſort, who haue little and the ſame homely prouiſion of fare, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of others that are full fed, and fare deliciouſly euery day, and are charged with many Children to bring vp; yet <note n="p" place="margin">Deut. 8, 2 Dan. 1, 13, 15.</note> both they and their children

So we may be well aſſured, that the Lord will much more prouide for our Soules, and bleſſe that prouiſion that he hath appointed for vs, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it it be but meane and ſimple. When a man is ſicke in body, he will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre that Phiſition which knoweth beſt the ſtate of his body, who is moſt likely to doe him moſt good, although perhaps ſome other be better learned and deeper skilled. Thus ought it to be with vs, our owne Paſtour, which is the Phyſition of our Soules, knoweth beſt our eſtate, ſeeth whereof wee haue neede, vnderſtandeth the Nature of our diſeaſe; and conſequently, is beſt able to reſtore vs to health againe. He that hath more learning, may profit by him that hath leſſe, may profit (I ſay) euen in knowledge. For the Lord ſpeaking by the mouth of his Miniſter, whom hee hath in ſome meaſure furniſhed with guifts, many times teacheth the wiſe by the ſimple, and the great learned man, by him that is inferiour to himſelfe. The Lord Ieſus <note n="q" place="margin">Iohn 1, 29.</note> was oftentimes preſent at the Sermons of <hi>Iohn.</hi> The Prophets that were extraordinarily called, diſdained not the Miniſtery of the Prieſtes, <note n="r" place="margin">Hag. 2, 11, 12.</note> but were content to learne the law of them. This is the Lordes doing, to aduance his owne glory, and to humble the higheſt Teachers of the Church. The Apoſtle hoped to profi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> by the <hi>Romaines,</hi> as <note n="ſ" place="margin">Rom. 1, 12.</note> they ſhould by him. Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Congregation or Pariſh, ſhould conſiſt of ſo many Chriſtians as can meet at one aſſembly.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles directed by the Spirit of God, were the Authours of this diuiſion and diſtinction; who hauing conuerted many to the Goſpell, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated them, and ordained them Elders, not onely according to the number of their Citties, <note n="t" place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſons why the people ſhould attend their owne Paſtours.</note> but alſo according to their ſeuerall multitudes, which are called Churches. For euen as God hath diſtributed the Ciuill State of the World into Kingdomes, Prouinces, Shires, Citties, and other Dominions, and hath ranged them into ſeuerall meetings: ſo he hath diuided his Church into certaine and ſeuerall aſſemblies, for the better ordering and edifying of them: and therefore the diſtinction of particular Churches, is not of humane inuention, but of diuine inſtitution.</p>
               <p>Hence it may be concluded and inferred, that one Paſtour cannot be ouer all aſſemblies, nor all aſſemblies vnder one Paſtour. Euery Shepheard muſt haue his owne Flocke, and euery Flocke muſt know his owne Shepheard. There is a neere band and mutuall coniunction betweene theſe two. The Miniſter is charged with his owne people by the ordinance of God, he muſt attend the Flock committed to his care and Cure, ouer which the Lord hath made him Watch-man and Ouer-ſeer. This is the knot that tyeth the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple faſt to their owne Paſtour. Euery one in the Ciuill State knoweth his owne Citty, and to what company he and his whole houſe doth belong. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Company in the Citty, knoweth to what iuriſdiction he belongeth. So it ought to be in the Church of Chriſt, euery particular Chriſtian ſhould be annexed vnto one certaine aſſembly, and bee there enrolled as a member of that ſociety, to liue vnder the Miniſtery and gouernment thereof. For where ſhall we rather hope to receiue good, then vnder that Miniſtery which the Lord hath ſet ouer vs? Or from whom rather ſhall we expect the bleſſing of God, then from him whoſe labours he hath promiſed to bleſſe? Hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith; <note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 13, 17</note> 
                  <hi>Obey them that haue the ouer-ſight of you, and ſubmit your ſelues, for they watch for your Soules as they that muſt giue accounts, that they may doe it with ioy, and not with greefe, for that is vnprofitable for you.</hi> Heere he addeth many reaſons, as it were vpon an heape, to vrge vs to this duty. If they watch for our Soules, we alſo ought to waite vpon them: If that they muſt render an account for our Soules, we muſt alſo render an
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7222:116"/> account of their labours beſtowed vpon vs. If they muſt doe it with ioy, and not with greefe, we are charged by our obedience to the Goſpell, and by ſubmitting our ſelues to the Miniſtery of our owne Paſtours, to Miniſter all comfort, and giue them cauſe of reioycing in their labours. But if wee ſeuer our ſelues from them, and refuſe their Miniſtery; we greeue them, not comfort them: we diſcourage them, not encourage them: we afflict them, not reioyce them. It is therefore a moſt vaine pretence, and great folly of ſuch as being reprooued for their negligence, in reſorting to their owne Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours; anſwere, that they can profit more by another, they can be edifyed better by hearing in another place, whereas peraduenture, they regard not to heare any man, and contemne the Goſpell, out of whoſe mouth ſoeuer it proceed and be vttered. Beſides, we haue greateſt hope of receiuing bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from our owne Paſtour, and euery member of the ſame aſſembly, muſt ſeeke the Lord, and ſerue him in the place appointed vnto vs for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and therefore wee ought not to with-draw our ſelues from thence, where our preſence is required. If God haue put the word of <note n="x" place="margin">2 Cor. 5, 15.</note> Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation into his mouth, to ſay vnto vs in the Name of the Lord, be ye recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled vnto God, and haue made an Ambaſſadour to ſpeake in his Name, who is he that ſhall ouer-rule the ordinance and counſell of God, or refuſe to ſubmit himſelfe vnto his moſt holy and mercifull aſſignement? Secondly, this conuinceth and reprooueth thoſe, that contemne, deride, ſcorne, abaſe, abuſe, and reuile their Miniſters.</p>
               <p>Theſe are vngodly and vngratious Children, that thus behaue themſelues toward their ſpirituall Fathers, and bereaue themſelues of the bleſſinges that belong to ſuch as obey their Parents. Theſe are like to curſſed <hi>Cham,</hi> that mocked his Father, and heard an horrible curſſe denounced againſt him, which tooke effect afterward in his ſeaſon: or to thoſe malicious Children, <note n="y" place="margin">2 King. 2, 24</note> which mocked the Prophet, ſcorned him and his calling, and brought vpon themſelues the iudgements of God. If we follow their ſinne, let vs looke for their end; if we walke in their waies, we muſt be aſſured of their wages: and if we imitate their deedes, wee ſhall be partakers of their deſtruction. How many are there among vs, that are growne to that hight of ſinne, that they regard not the doctrine that is deliuered, but ſet themſelues againſt the Miniſter that doth deliuer it? Theſe men are growne to bee ſhameleſſe and impudent, that regard not the meanes of ſaluation, nor eſteeme of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, nor deſire to heare of their ſinnes. Theſe haue ſtiffe neckes and hard hearts, they are come to ſit downe in the ſeat of the Scorners, and they ſhall haue the reward of Scorners. And let all ſuch as will know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, learne this as a certaine rule gathered out of a continual Tenor of the Scriptures, and the conſtant courſe of Gods iudgements, that when once they beginne to make a mocke of ſinne, and of the meanes that ſhould reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them out of their ſinne, then wrath is not farre from them, but is neere vnto them. The more preſumptuous and ſecure they are, the neerer to deſtruction. We ſee this in the people of Iſraell. 2. Chron. 36. 16. When once they began to dally with God; nay, with their owne ſoules, <note n="z" place="margin">2 Chron. 36 16.</note> and moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Meſſengers that the Lord God of their Fathers ſent to them, riſing early and late (for he had compaſſion on his people, and on his habitation) he brought vpon them the King of the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> who ſpared neither young man nor Virgine, neither auncient nor aged, God gaue all into his handes. This is a fearefull example of his iudgements, that fell vpon this people for their contempt of the word, and miſuſing the Meſſengers that were ſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; to teach all men to beware, and be warned of falling into the ſame ſinne, and returne betimes, that (if it be poſſible) his plagues may be preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by timely repentance. Few that runne thus farre looke backe againe, to ſay, what haue we done? When the meaſure of ſinne is perfected, the time
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:7222:116" rendition="simple:additions"/> of iudgement is haſtned. Howbeit God is able to touch and to turne their hearts; and his word before contemned, if now it be beleeued, is able to ſaue their Soules.</p>

               <p>To conclude, <hi>Elihu</hi> ſetting downe diuers meanes that God hath, and vſeth to inſtruct Man, and to draw him out of ſinne vnto himſelfe, maketh this one, and one of the principall; <note n="f" place="margin">Iob. 33, 23, 24.</note> 
                  <hi>If there be a Meſſenger with him, or an Interpretour, one of a thouſand, to declare vnto man his righteouſneſſe, then will he haue mercy vpon him, and will ſay; Deliuer him that he goe not downe into the pit, for I haue receiued a reconciliation.</hi> Theſe teſtimonies, both of the Prophets and Apoſtles, are plaine to proue, that the word preached is the ordinary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall cauſe of our conuerſion and regeneration, and the meanes that God hath ſanctified to bring vs to bee members of the Church, and Heires of Saluation.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 1.</note> The Reaſons are very plaine to confirme this point of Doctrine. Firſt, the word is of a moſt powerfull and piercing Nature, it is hotter then the fire, it is ſtronger then the Hammer, it is ſharper then the Sword, it is ſweeter then the Hony, it is purer then the Gold: it is better then the Pearles: more nouriſhable then meate, more forceable then the Leauen, more profitable then the Raine, more comfortable then the Dew that falleth vpon the Herbs. It is able to make a Blinde man ſee; a Crooked man, ſtraight; a Bond man, free; a poore man, rich; a ſicke man, whole; nay, a dead man, it is able to make aliue againe.

This the Apoſtle teſtifieth. 1 Cor. 1. and maketh this the reaſon why God will ſaue vs by the hearing of Faith preached; <note n="n" place="margin">1 Cor. 1, 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Seeing the World by it owne wiſedome, knew not God in the wiſedome of God, it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſſe of preaching to ſaue them that beleeue.</hi> There is a double knowledge of God, and a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way to know him: one, Naturall, the other Spirituall. Naturall, by the ſight of the Creatures, by the view of the world, by beholding the heauens, <note n="o" place="margin">Pſal. 19, 1. Rom. 1, 19.</note> which declare the glory of God, whereby the eternity, the Maieſty, the power, the wiſedome, the greatneſſe, the goodneſſe of God doe appeare. Spirituall, by hearing and hearkning vnto the word of God, which not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beareth witneſſe to thoſe eſſentiall properties of God, more ſufficiently and fully then the former, but ſetteth down diſtinctly the Trinity of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and the mercy of God toward the elect, promiſed and performed vnto them for Chriſts ſake. Naturall reaſon is blind in the matters of God, and though it may ſerue to make vs without excuſe, it cannot ſuffice to bring vs to ſaluation without a farther and better guide. So then, the Lord, to make the wiſedome of the World fooliſhneſſe, and to gaine glory to his owne Name, and to ſhew that he hath vouchſafed that grace &amp; mercy to vs which he denyed to the wiſeſt among the Gentiles, that were learned and skilfull in all humane knowledge, but were vtterly ignorant of his Word, hath raiſed vp to vs a light which they neuer ſaw, and made vs to heare the ſound of a voyce which they neuer heard. Seeing therefore the word preached is of ſo great force, that it cauſeth Faith in vs, which all the wiſedome of the World could neuer worke: it followeth, that this word of God, is the ordinarie cauſe or Inſtrument of our conuerſion and ſaluation.</p>
               <p>This is ſo plain, &amp; ſo pregnant a truth, that it is greatly to be wondred, that any ſhould ſtumble or ſtagger at it, and that all doe not ſubmit themſelues
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:7222:117" rendition="simple:additions"/> vnto it. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiections brought to proue preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to be the ordinarie meanes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get faith.</note> But becauſe doubts ariſe, and Obiections are made againſt this point and principle, plainly proued, and firmely eſtabliſhed by reaſons out of the Scripture; let vs ſee what they are, and how they may be anſwered. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection 1.</note> Firſt of all, it is obiected, that there are other meanes effectuall, to worke Faith, and to bring to Repentance: as afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or priuat admonition. Touching afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſuch as liued in Idolatry, in ignoraunce, in vncleanneſſe, that fauoured wholly of the fleſh, and nothing at all of the ſpirit, haue bin brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and forſake their ſinnes, and to humble them-ſelues vnder the mightie hand of God; ſome being afflicted in body <note n="p" place="margin">2 Chron.</note> as <hi>Manaſſeth:</hi> others, troubled in Conſcience, feeling the wound of the ſpirit, &amp; groaning vnder the ſtroke of Gods iudgements, <note n="q" place="margin">Actes 9, 6.</note> as <hi>Paule</hi> in his conuerſion, haue by this meanes had Faith and Repentance giuen vnto them. And touching priuate exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is made auayleable to turne vs to God. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle teaching that a beleeuing Husband may with a ſafe Conſcience vſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of an vnbeleeuing Wife, and a beleeuing Wife vſe the companie of an vnbeleeuing husband, ſo that the one ought not depart from the other: hee vſeth this Reaſon, <note n="q" place="margin">1 Cor, 7, 12, 13, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>For what knoweſt thou, O Wife, whether thou ſhalt ſaue thy Husband? Or what knoweſt thou (O Man) whether thou ſhalt ſaue thy Wife?</hi> So the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſetting downe the wiues duty toward her husband, ſaith <note n="r" place="margin">1 Pet. 3, 1</note> 
                  <hi>Let their wiues be ſubiect to their Husbandes, that euen they which obey not the word, may without the word be wonne by the conuerſation of their wiues.</hi> Where we ſee, that ſome are won to the Faith, without the preaching of the worde. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> I anſwere, it is true that God bleſſeth and ſanctifieth many meanes beſide the preaching of the word, to the good of his Children, as Meditation, Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, priuate inſtruction, Prayer, feare of Hell, and ſuch like. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, many that are conuerted to God, are deceiued in the meanes and inſtrument of their conuerſion. For, albeit ſuch as are afflicted are brought to know themſelues, and to acknowledge the damnable eſtate wherein they ſtood, yet it is not the affliction it ſelfe that wrought their conuerſion. The trouble that they ſuſtained and endured, whether it were in body, or in mind, or in both, was ſent by the goodneſſe of God vpon them, to bring them to a loue of the word, who before loathed it, and made no account or reckning of it. This is it which the Apoſtle teacheth, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Rom. 3, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>That by the Lawe commeth the knowledge of ſinne.</hi> So affliction may lay before vs the knowledge of our ſins, but it cannot take them away: it may ſhew vs our wound, but it cannot help vs, and heale vs: it may caſt vs downe, but it cannot raiſe vs vp: it may bee a Schoole-maiſter to bring vs to Chriſt, but it cannot make vs partakers of Chriſt. It is like a ſharpe Needle, which doth not, nor cannot ſow the cloth, but it is neceſſarie to prepare the way for the thred; or it is like an eating or a fretting corraſiue which cannot cure, but yet it is profitable to make the way for the healing medicine. So the afflictions that God layeth vpon vs, may bring vs to the ſight and knowledge of our ſinnes, and to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the miſeries which we deſerue, and to the feeling of the flaſhes of hell fire: but they cannot worke Faith in vs, nor aſſure vs of pardon, nor apply to vs the promiſe of God touching the remiſſion of ſinnes. It maketh a good beginning, but it cannot bring the worke to perfection. The like may bee ſaide of priuate admonition, and a godly conuerſation, which the Apoſtles teach may be meanes of ſaluation to others: it is not ſpoken to leſſen or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the authority or efficacy of publicke preaching, as if it were not the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary meanes to conceiue, nouriſh, and encreaſe faith in vs; neither is it ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to be vnderſtood that they are able to conuert the ſoule, but onely that they are good occaſions, fit inducements, and profitable helpes to drawe vs and allure vs to a liking, and louing, and longing after faith. For when a man that is not a Chriſtian, but an Infidell, beholdeth the holy, pure, &amp; chaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation of his Wife after her calling to the knowledge of the truth, and hir
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:7222:118" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſubiection and obedience toward himſelfe, he may be mooued to embrace the Chriſtian Religion, whereof he ſeeth ſuch worthy fruites. We haue a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table example heerof, in <note n="u" place="margin">Ioh. 4, 39. 42</note> the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> who perſwading the men of the Citty to go out and heare Chriſt, they ſaide vnto her after they hadde heard his preaching, <hi>Now we beleeue, not becauſe of thy ſaying, for we haue herd him our ſelues, and know that this is indeede that Chriſt the Sauior of the world.</hi> The exhortation of this woman preuailed with them to heare Chriſt, and by their hearing they were conuerted: ſhe was the cauſe of their hearing, their hearing was the cauſe of their beleeuing; ſhee was the Inſtrument that brought them to Chriſt, and hee wrought Faith in them, when they vvere brought vnto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection 2.</note> Secondly, it is ſaide that reading is preaching, and therefore it is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent meanes of ſaluation. To this purpoſe they quote, <hi>Actes</hi> 21. <hi>Moſes of olde time hath in euery City them that preach him, ſeeing he is read in the Synagogue euery Saboth day.</hi> Loe (ſay they) he is preached when he is read, therfore the bare reading muſt needs be preaching; yea, ſome adde it is better then prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, becauſe when they heare the Scriptures read, they knowe it is the word of God; but when they heare preaching, it is mens expoſition and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, and they know not whether it bee true or falſe, ſound or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound, right or wrong. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> I anſwere, this obiection falleth of it ſelfe, and it is ouerthrowne by that, whereby it is ſought to be ſtrengthned. For if rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding be preaching, then reading cannot be better then preaching, inaſmuch as nothing can be better or worſe then it ſelfe. It is not denied but the word <hi>(Preaching)</hi> may in a general ſence include not only the reading of the word <note n="x" place="margin">Marke 1, 45. &amp; 5 20. &amp; 7. 36</note> but any other way of declaring and publiſhing the power, truth, glory, and workes of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2, 20, 21. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19, 1, 2. but then it is not vſed as wee take the word in the ſtate of the queſtion. For wee meane by preaching the expounding of the Scripture, according to the proportion of faith, &amp; apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof according to the capacity of the hearers. And thus they are ſet downe in the place alledged before, as two diſtinct things, one accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and following the other, according to the ordinance of God, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the ſeruants of God. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle giueth this as a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and direction belonging to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="margin">1 Tim. 4, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Till I come, giue attendance to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, to exhortation, and to Doctrine.</hi> So it is ſayde in the booke of <hi>Nehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> 
                  <note n="z" place="margin">Nehe. 8, 7, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>The Leuites cauſed the people to vnderſtand the Law, and the people ſtood in their place, and they read in the Booke of the Law of God diſtinctly, and gaue the ſence, and cauſed them to vnderſtand the reading.</hi> Likewiſe when Chriſt came to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> where he had beene brought vp, and went into the Synagogue on the Saboth day, he ſtood vp, <hi>He opened the Booke,</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Luke 4, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>and read the Scripture: then he cloſed the Booke, he ſate downe, the eyes of all of them were faſtned on him, and he began to preach vnto them.</hi> Thus alſo wee ſee, that when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paule</hi> wrote his Epiſtle to the Romaines, hee excuſed himſelfe that hee could not come to preach vnto them, <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 1, 11, 15, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>For he longed to ſee them that he might beſtow ſome ſpirituall guift among them, and acknowledged himſelfe a debter to the Grecians, and to the Barbarians, to the Wiſemen, and vnto the vnwiſe, ſo that as much as lay in him, hee was ready to preach the Goſpell to them alſo that were at Rome.</hi> Whereby we ſee, that preaching and hearing are not wtiting and reading: and therefore, as the Apoſtle when hee wrote, did not preach, ſo the people when they read, did not heare.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, if we ſhould reaſon a little farther with ſuch as preferre ſimple reading before ſound preaching, how do they know that the worde which they heare read, is the word of God? For the Scipture inſpired of God is the Originals, the Hebrew of the olde Teſtament, the Greeke of the newe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, in other tongues it ſpeaketh not but by an interpreter; for from theſe two tongues and languages the Scriptures were turned and tranſlated
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7222:118"/> by men, into the French by Frenchmen, into the Dutch by Dutchmen, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Engliſh by Engliſhmen, and ſo of all other Nations. So that when we read, or heare read the Scriptures in our owne tongues, wee read and heare read the tranſlations of men: as when this word is preached we hear the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and interpretations of men. And hence it is, that the tranſlations; euen the beſt tranſlations which are among vs, may be amended and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, according as it pleaſeth God to giue greater ſight, and better inſight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe learned Languages, and as time diſcouereth the wantes and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of them. But the Scriptures themſelues are free from all errour, no weakneſſe can be diſcouered in them, they cannot bee made better by the iudgement of men, or by length of time. For al Gods workes are pure and perfect, and no man can controule any thing in them. If this be true (may ſome ſay) that the tranſlations of the Scriptures are in ſome ſort the worke of man, how ſhall the people know when they haue and heare the worde of God, and when they haue and heare the word of man? This may ſeeme to leaue them in a maze and mammering, and to hang their Faith vpon the will of men, that they ſhall not knowe what to beleeue. I aunſwere, they muſt haue in all doubts that ariſe, and in all Controuerſies that do trouble them, they muſt haue (I ſay) recourſe to their faithfull and learned Paſtors, whoſe care ouer them, and loue vnto them, may giue them hope that their ſenſes are exerciſed in the wiſe diſcerning betweene good and euill. Whereby, by the way we may ſee, the neceſſitie of hauing Paſtours and Teachers, able to teach, to conuince, to correct, to inſtruct, to comfort, to reſolue ſuch doubts and demaunds as are mooued vnto them. Beſides, the people of God haue for their direction, both the helpe of comparing one place of Scripture with another, and the aſſiſtance of the ſpirit, to lead them vnto all truth that ſhall be neceſſary for them to ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, if we ſhould demaund of theſe men that are wiſe in their own eyes, how they know the word read to be the holy Scripture, what will they anſwere? Will they ſay, by the authoritie of the Church, or by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ſpirit? But whatſoeuer they ſpeake, they muſt ſpeak againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. If they ſay by the Church, the Church alſo ſetteth foorth the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpell, and chargeth vs to heare the ſame at the mouth of the Miniſter. Will they ſay by the Spirit? the ſame Spirit will lead them into all truth, and open their hearts to attend the preaching Miniſtry, if they be led by the ſpirit of God. Wherefore to conclude, and to returne to the former obiection, ſuch as hold reading to be preaching, or better then preaching, are either ſuch as are Idoll-Shepheardes that cannot preach, or idle Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards that will not preach, or ignorant people that cannot iudge, or carnall Goſpellers, that regard not to heare, or ſuch conceited ſluggards, as liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a reading Miniſtry. Theſe are they that condemne the Prieſts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, nay Chriſt and his Apoſtles of want of wiſedome and diſcretion, to chooſe the beſt meanes; or of ignorance to knowe and vnderſtand what is moſt profitable; or of malice and enuy, to hide from them that which is moſt profitable, or of malice and enuy to hide from them that which is moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileable for their ſoules health. For, if reading be better, they are to bee blamed that vſe the worſe, and refuſe the better. Surely, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue preached at all, if the naked reading had beene as effectuall. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, the reading Miniſter by this reaſon, ſhould be the beſt Miniſter, &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, a better guift then preaching; yea, euery childe might be a better Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter then he that preacheth the word. And then, what ſhould we do with Vniuerſities and Schooles of Learning, which are the Nurſes and Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Church, to traine vp able men, and to furniſh them with giftes of knowledge. But the guiftes which Chriſt beſtowed for the edification of his Church, when hee aſcended on high, and ledde Captiuitie Captiue,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7222:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Epheſ. 4, 11, 12, 13.</note> are all preaching guifts. The want of guifts which the Prophets complaine to haue beene in the guides of the people, <note n="d" place="margin">Eſay 56, 10.</note> was not of reading and reciting the words out of the booke, but the guifts of preaching and expounding the Scriptures. Hence it is, that God reiecteth thoſe that be ignorant, as vnfit and vnable Inſtruments of ſaluation, <note n="e" place="margin">Hoſea 4, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>My people are deſtroyed for lacke of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, becauſe thou haſt refuſed knowledge; I will alſo refuſe thee, that thou ſhalt be no Prieſt to me.</hi> And in another place, <note n="f" place="margin">Mal. 2, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>The Prieſts lips ſhould preſerue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and they ſhall ſeeke the Lawe at his Mouth, for hee is the Meſſenger of the Lord of hoaſts.</hi> Laſtly, the preaching of the word is acknowledged &amp; confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be the onely <note n="g" place="margin">Eſay 49, 22. 2 Chron. 15, 3.</note> eſſential mark of the Church, ſo that it alone is of force to worke faith and ſaluation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection 3</note> Thirdly, if reading of the Scriptures be not an ordinary meanes to worke Faith in Chriſt, and Repentance from dead works, as well as the liuely prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of them, it will follow that the Miniſters themſelues want the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meanes, becauſe they by reading doe furniſh themſelues to preach to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but ſeldome do heare others preach. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> I anſwere, they want not the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie meanes from their owne preaching, though they haue no other, though they heare no other. They haue faith before they enter into that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but it is confirmed by their owne Miniſtry. Hence it is, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle mouing <hi>Timothy</hi> to giue himſelfe to reading, to be diligent in exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to plant ſound Doctrine, and to encreaſe in ſuch guiftes as were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon him, addeth, <note n="h" place="margin">1 Tim, 4, 16</note> 
                  <hi>Take heede to thy ſelfe, and vnto learning: continue therein, for in doing thus, thou ſhalt ſaue both thy ſelfe, and them that hear thee.</hi> Where we ſee, he ſheweth that his Miniſtry ſhould be a meanes not only to ſaue others, but to ſaue himſelfe. And there is no faithfull Miniſter, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing, he reproueth himſelfe; in teaching, he teacheth himſelf; in threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he threatneth himſelfe; in comforting, hee comforteth himſelfe; in ſtrengthning others, he ſtrengthneth himſelfe; yea, hee findeth and feeleth his owne Miniſtry as forcible and powerfull to his own ſoule, as euer he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the Miniſtry of another. The threatninges of God denounced by his owne mouth in the name of GOD, haue made him ſhake: the conſolations that he hath pronounced, haue entred into his ſoule, and refreſhed his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. And of this we haue from time to time to our owne comfort, a bleſſed experience. Beſides, if the Lord would bleſſe other wayes and means to the Miniſter, who is neceſſarily reſtrained by the commandement of God, &amp; the diſcharge of his calling from the hearing of others, what is that to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are charged to heare the Law from their mouthes, and no way hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from the performance of this duty? ſo that they muſt followe the way that God hath left vnto them, that is; to attend to the ordinance which hee hath chalked out vnto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection 4.</note> Fourthly, it may be ſaide, that Chriſt appointed reading to be an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meanes to beget Faith, when he ſendeth out his Apoſtles into the world, to <note n="i" place="margin">Math. 28, 14</note> teach all Nations, which includeth a commaundement to teach them by writing, as well as by worde, and conſequently implyeth, that the people ſhould be taught as well by reading their writings, as by hearing their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings to come vnto faith. Heereupon it is, that Chriſt willeth the people to ſearch <note n="k" place="margin">Iohn 5, 39. and 20, 31. Luke 16.</note> 
                  <hi>the Scripture, becauſe in them they thought to haue eternall life, &amp; they did teſtifie of him.</hi> And the Apoſtle Iohn ſaith, <hi>Theſe things are written that yee might beleeue, that Ieſus is that Chriſt, that ſonne of God, and that in beleeuing ye might haue life through his name.</hi> So <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaide to the rich man, <hi>They haue Moſes and the Prophets, let them heare them.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> I aunſwere, the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement giuen to the Apoſtles, concerneth principally the preaching of the Goſpell by word of mouth, and liuely voice vttered in the hearing of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and therefore ſome of them wrote more, ſome of them leſſe, ſome of them nothing at all. But if the commandement had beene as general for wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7222:119" rendition="simple:additions"/> as for preaching, none of the Apoſtles would haue omitted it, nor could haue ſtayed their pennes without a manifeſt breach of their owne duty, and Gods commandement. Now, ſo farre as their writing was one kind of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and included in that word, the meaning is for confirmation &amp; preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of that truth which they deliuered &amp; preached among them. Thus the Apoſtle ſpeaketh to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 
                  <note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 15, 1, 2</note> 
                  <hi>I declare vnto you the Goſpell which I preached vnto you, which ye haue alſo receiued, and wherein ye continue, &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ye are ſaued, if ye keepe in memory after what manner I preached vnto you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye haue beleeued in vaine.</hi> Likewiſe writing to the Romaines, <note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 15, 14 15.</note> 
                  <hi>I my ſelfe am perſwaded of you (my Brethren) that ye alſo are full of goodneſſe, &amp; filled with all knowledge, and are able to admoniſh one another: neuertheleſſe, I haue ſomwhat boldly after a ſort, written vnto you as one that putteth you in remembrance, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the grace that is giuen me of God.</hi> So the Apoſtle Iohn ſaith, <note n="n" place="margin">1 Iohn 2, 21</note> 
                  <hi>I haue not written vnto you, becauſe ye know not the truth, but becauſe ye know it, &amp; that no lye is of the truth.</hi> Whereby we ſee, that they wrote to thoſe to whome before they had preached, to confirme them in the truth, which they had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and receiued. They did not write to them that were wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the truth, and had neuer heard the Goſpell: but to ſuch as they hadde taught, to the end that either ſtanding in it, they might be eſtabliſhed, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falne from it, they might be recouered and reclaimed. Thus he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <note n="o" place="margin">1 Theſ. 3, 12</note> the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> becauſe they had kept all the ordinances and tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions receiued from him; and thus he telleth the <hi>Galathians,</hi> 
                  <note n="p" place="margin">Galath. 1, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>That he maruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led much, that they were ſo ſoon remoued away vnto another Goſpell, from him that had called them in the grace of Chriſt.</hi> It remaineth therefore, to anſwere ſuch teſtimonies as are alledged to iuſtifie the ſufficiency of reading, and to make it an ordinary meanes of ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Touching the place, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. commanding the ſearching of the ſcriptures, Chriſt Ieſus in the ſame referreth them to the Scriptures or worde written to correct their iudgements touching himſelfe, his perſon, and offices. For, whereas they beleeued not the Sermons of Chriſt, and the Lord Ieſus could not ſafely referre them to the chaire of the Scribes and Phariſees, who were groſſely deceiued, and maliciouſly blinded in that Myſtery, there remayned onely the reading and ſearching of the Scriptures, that thereby they might learne the truth of his Sermons.</p>
               <p>Againe, where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Theſe things were written that ye might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, Iohn</hi> 20. it is to be vnderſtood of the Myracles of Chriſt, wrought for confirmation of his Doctrine, and for ſtrengthning of faith, as appeareth in the words immediately going before, <note n="q" place="margin">Iohn 20, 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Many other ſignes alſo did Ieſus in the preſence of his Diſeiples, which are not written in this Booke.</hi> And that this is the true and right end of Myracles, apeareth by the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where he ſheweth, that the Goſpell began firſt to be preached by the Lorde, and afterward was confirmed vnto vs by them that heard him, <note n="r" place="margin">Heb. 2, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>God bearing witneſſe thereto, both with ſignes and wonders, and with diuers Myracles &amp; gifts of the Holy-ghoſt, according to his owne will.</hi>

               <p>Laſtly, where it is ſaide, <hi>They haue the Bookes of Moſes, and the writings of the Prophets, let them heare them,</hi> Luke 16. This is the ſumme of all our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and preachings, we preach nothing out of the Law and the Prophets, but both <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, muſt bee expounded and applyed. The Eunuch <note n="f" place="margin">Act. 8, 30, 31</note> ſitting in his Chariot, had <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and read them as he ſat; yet when <hi>Phillip</hi> came to him, and asked, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandeſt thou what thou readeſt?</hi> He anſwered, <hi>How can I without a guide?</hi> Furthermore, the reading of the Scriptures, is not heere oppoſed againſt the preaching of them, but againſt Viſions and Apparitions of the dead, as the Prophet ſpeaketh, <note n="t" place="margin">Eſa. 8, 19, 20</note> 
                  <hi>When they ſhall ſay vnto you, Enquire of them that haue a ſpirit of diuination, and at the Soothſayers which whiſper and murmure, ſhould not a people enquire at their God?
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7222:120" rendition="simple:additions"/> From the liuing to the dead?</hi> To the Law, and to the Teſtimony, if they ſpeake not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection 5.</note> Fiftly, if the word preached bee the ordinary meanes of bringing vs vnto ſanctification, and ſo to ſaluation; then where it is not, there is not ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaluation, and conſequently no Church viſible, where no Miniſter is. Heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſhall condemne many particular Congregations to be no viſible chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, becauſe they want the publicke preaching of the word. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> I anſwere, let this bee ſuppoſed which is not graunted, yet in ſuch aſſemblies many may appertaine and belong to the Church Catholicke.

Thus no doubt it was in <hi>Iſraell,</hi> when they were without a Prieſt to teach them, euen then God reſerued vnto himſelf ſeuen thouſand that bowed not the knee to <hi>Baal.</hi> Thus Chriſt himſelfe teacheth, that when the Laborers were few, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9, 37. yet the Harueſt was great. Thus it was in many of the Iewiſh Synagogues, that were diſperſed heere and there among the Nations, <note n="u" place="margin">Acts 13, 15.</note> where they hadde the Lecture of the Law and the Prophets: and when <hi>Paule</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tted into the Synagogue on the Saboth day, the Rulers of the ſame ſent vnto them, and ſaid; <hi>Ye men and Brethren, if ye haue any word of exhortation for the people, ſay on.</hi> Whereby it may be gathered, that vnleſſe the Apoſtles had com at that preſent, the aſſembly had bin diſmiſſed without preaching. When <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah</hi> the Prieſt, was ſtrucken <note n="x" place="margin">Luke 1, 23.</note> dumbe by the hand of God, ſo that he could not ſpeak to the people, yet he continued the time of his courſe, &amp; the people were preſent at his miniſtration. The Prieſts vnder the law were oftentimes vnlearned and vnſufficient, yet were they not therfore no prieſts at al, neither did the people refuſe the ſeruice of the tabernacle, being done with their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waſhen hands. So ought we to do in the want of a preaching miniſtry, when we cannot haue al that we would, or that we ſhould haue, we muſt be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to take what they can giue, &amp; what we cannot haue at home, we muſt ſeek abroad, or rather with <hi>Dauid,</hi>

This is not ſpoken to defend ignorant Miniſters, who are vnwoorthy of the places which they hold, but to ſhew that we are not to ſeparate for euery want and blemiſh in the Church, but rather to tollerate that which we are by no meanes able to redreſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection 6</note> Laſtly, it may be ſaide, that Sermons written by the Miniſter, and read to the people, may breed Faith and Repentance in vs, and therefore much more the Sermons of the Prophets and Apoſtles. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> I anſwere breefely, firſt of our Sermons written, and then of the Sermons of the Prophets &amp; Apoſtles writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and then read to the hearers, or by the hearers. Firſt, touching our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons written, if they be the right diuiding of the word, and proceede from the guifts of the Miniſter, enforced thereunto by weakneſſe and infirmitie, they are to be held a preaching, and may worke a faith. This is not ſpoken to be a Patron of ydleneſſe, of ignorance, of negligence, of careleſneſſe, but it is ſpoken to ſupport the weake, to moue them to cal vpon God to ſtrengthen them, and to perſwade the people not to deſpiſe their miniſtery. Secondly, touching the Sermons recorded and read in the Scriptures preached by the Prophets and Apoſtles, they are not rehearſed at large as they were deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but ſummarily ſet downe, with intent to bee diuided and opened by the

               </p>
               <p>This regeneration making a beginning, and giuing vs an entraunce into the kingdome of God, cannot bee attained without the hearing of Gods word preached; and the word it ſelfe cannot bee publiſhed without a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, ſo that Preachers are the ſoueraigne meanes appointed of God to work Faith, Repentance, and ſaluation in all his children.

               <p>Touching the firſt, wee may behold the wretched caſe of thoſe that are without the preaching of the word; they liue in blindneſſe &amp; darkneſſe, they walke in places of continuall danger, and yet cannot ſee their way, they liue without the ordinarie meanes of life and ſaluation, and ſo without hope to come to repentance, without which there can be no ſaluation. This is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of Iewes, of Turkes, and Infidels, that are depriued of the comfortable vſe of the word, and they that liue in corners where the ſound thereof is not heard. Theſe want the bread of life, and therfore muſt needs ſtarue &amp; periſh. They haue not the words <note n="c" place="margin">Iohn 6, 68. Rom. 1, 16.</note> of eternal life, which are the power of God to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, &amp; therfore are neer to deſtruction. For it is the maner of gods dealing <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Auguſt de bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no perſeuer.</hi>
                  </note> to deny vnto men the meanes whereby they ſhould beleeue, when hee hath no purpoſe that they ſhould beleeue, &amp; he withdrawes from them the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:7222:121"/> whereby they ſhould be conuerted, when he doth not purpoſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their conuerſion. It was a fearfull curſſe when God ſaid to his Apoſtles, <note n="e" place="margin">Math. 10, 5. Acts 16, 6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into the Citty of the Samaritans enter ye not.</hi> Likewiſe, when they had gone through <hi>Phrygia,</hi> and the Region of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia,</hi> they were forbidden by the Holy-Ghoſt to preach the worde in <hi>Aſia;</hi> then came they to <hi>Myſia,</hi> and ſought to go into <hi>Bithynia,</hi> but the ſpirit ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them not. So when God vouchſafeth not this mercie vnto vs, to wit; the Miniſtry of his word; it is a fearefull ſigne of his heauy indignation, and as much in effect, as if the Lord ſhould ſay, I will not haue them conuerted, I haue no purpoſe to bring them to ſaluation.</p>
               <p>This is it which is ſpoken concerning <hi>Iſraell</hi> by the Prophet, <note n="f" place="margin">2 Chr. 15, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Now for a long ſeaſon Iſraell hath beene without the true God, and without a Prieſt to teach, and without Law.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe Amos ſpeaketh, <note n="g" place="margin">Amos 8, 11, 12, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold, the daies come ſaith the Lord God, that I will ſend a famine in the Land, not a famine for Bread, nor a thirſt for water, but of hearing the word of the Lorde: and they ſhall wander from Sea to Sea, and from the North euen vnto the Eaſt, ſhall they runue too and fro to ſeeke the word of the Lord, and ſhall not finde it, in that day ſhall the young <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgins, and the young men perriſh for thirſt.</hi> O that we could conſider of theſe things, and lay before our eyes what daunger it is to want the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word, that thereby we might be moued to pitty the deſolations of ſo many of our poore Brethren, and to feare the taking of it away for our vnthankfulneſſe from our ſelues, and to magnifie the vnſpeakeable mercy of God toward vs, while we do enioy it. Great are the plagues, and horrible are the ruines of the Church in many places. Oh, that we had harts to mourn for it, and to pray to the Lord of the harueſt, to thruſt forth Labourers into his harueſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it teacheth the fearfull condition of ſuch as contemne this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, and thinke it too baſe for them to ſeeke ſaluation by it. It is very ſtrange, that ſo plaine a point as this, ſhould be ſo proudly gainſayed and reſiſted. Theſe carnall men will not giue the Lord of heauen leaue to apoint how and by what meanes he will ſaue vs. Shall fleſh and blood preſume thus farre, and aduance it ſelfe againſt his Creator? If we will be ſaued, wee muſt ſeeke ſaluation, as it is left vs to ſeeke, and not after our owne fanſie. When God hath ſaide, Giue attendance to my word; wilt thou anſwere, I will not attend, and yet haue ſaluation as well as if thou diddeſt attend? Take heede thou do not deceiue thy ſelfe and thine owne ſoule, and in the end finde thy ſelfe fruſtrate of thy ſaluation. How men will ſhift off theſe duties, I knowe not, becauſe I know not their hearts; but this I know, and this I would haue them know and vnderſtand, that as there is a God that will bee worſhipped after his owne will, and not according to our naturall wit; ſo this muſt bee our wiſedome, to ſubmit our conceites and immaginations to his heauenlie pleaſure. It is the firſt point in Chriſtian Religion, to be learned, to account thy ſelfe a Foole, that thou mayeſt bee wiſe in Chriſt, and to throwe downe all thy Naturall parts at his feete, that thou mayeſt ſeeke true and Heauenlie Wiſedome of him. Thou muſt account thy ſelfe ſtarke blinde, and able to perceiue nothing aright in the matters of God, and in the meanes of thy ſaluation, to the end thou mayeſt recouer ſight, and ſee thy way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in in thou oughteſt to walke. Hence it is, that the Prophet ſayth, <note n="h" place="margin">Pſal. 119, 18 27, 34.</note> 
                  <hi>Open mine eyes, that I may ſee the wonders of thy Lawe: Make mee to vnderſtand the way of thy Precepts, and I will meditate in thy wonderous workes; Giue mee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and I will keepe thy Law, yea I will keepe it with my whole hart.</hi> Where hee acknowledgeth his eyes to be cloſed, his eares to be ſtopped, his minde to be darkened, his heart to be hardned by nature, before Grace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie come and make the way plaine before him, wherby our eyes ſhall be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, out eares boared, our mindes enlightned, our hearts ſoftened, and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7222:121"/> our ſelues prepared to hearken to the voyce of God ſpeaking vnto vs. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> But is not God able to ſaue vs without the Miniſters preaching, and the peoples hearing? Are not all thinges poſſible to him? Is hee bound and tyed to his owne meanes? Is not he free to worke as it pleaſeth him? <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> I anſwer, he is not tyed, he is free, hee is able to ſaue without preaching, yea without reading, without the Sacraments, without Prayer. Wilt thou from hence conclude againſt reading of the Scriptures, againſt receiuing of the Sacraments, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ioyning in Prayer? The queſtion is not of the power of God, but of his will; not what he is able to do, but what he hath promiſed vs to do; not what he is tyed to, but what he hath bound vs to ſeek. He is able to preſerue our life without Bread, without foode; but he that preſumeth vpon this power, and abuſeth his prouidence, and neglecteth to ſeek his nouriſhment at his hands, muſt look to periſh: So we deny not but God is able to ſaue vs without prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, but he hath not made vs any promiſe to obtain life any otherwiſe then as we ſeeke the Law at the mouths of his Miniſters, that bring glad tydings of good things. He was able to preſerue his three ſeruants in the hot fierie furnace, and did preſerue them; yet hee that will voluntarily and violently caſt himſelfe into the fire, ſhall feele the ſmart of his own folly, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of tempting God. Let vs not therfore thinke our ſelues wiſer then God, leaſt our wiſedome in the end be turned into folly, our preſumption into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire, our dallying with the word, into deſtruction. Thirdly, wee are put in mind by this meanes of our regeneration, to acknowledge the happy eſtate and condition of that Nation, of that people, of that pariſh, to whome God hath vouchſafed the preaching of his word, becauſe it is a ſure pledg &amp; proof of his loue toward them, and a manifeſt argument and teſtimony that he hath a Church there to be gathered, a people to be conuerted, and many ſoules to be ſaued. For euen as God withholdeth the meanes of ſaluation from thoſe that he doth not determine to ſaue, <note n="i" place="margin">1 King. 17, 1.</note> 
                  <hi>As he ſtayeth the heauens from raining vpon the earth when he will bring a famine, ſo when he will ſhew mercy, he wil ſend the meanes plentifully.</hi> It was a great mercy to the Iewes, when Chriſt called his Diſciples, <note n="k" place="margin">Math. 10, 6.</note> and bad them <hi>Go and preach to the loſt ſheepe of the houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, that the kingdom of heauen was at hand.</hi> It was a great bleſſing intended to the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> when a viſion appeared to <hi>Paul</hi> in the night, <note n="l" place="margin">Acts 19, 6, 10 and 18, 10, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>There ſtood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, ſaying, Come into Macedonia, and help vs: whereby Paul was aſſured, that the Lord had called him to preach the Gospell vnto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was a great fauour beſtowed vppon the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> when the Lorde ſaide to <hi>Paul, Feare not, but ſpeake, and hold not thy peace, for I am with thee, and no man ſhall lay hands on thee to hurt thee, for I haue much people in this City, ſo he continued there a yeare and ſixe months, and taught the word of God among them.</hi> Where the Lord telleth his ſeruant, that he had people there, whome he meant to ſaue, and therefore he ſent them his word to ſaue them; yea, he had much people there to ſaue; and therefore the Apoſtle muſt beſtow much time and diligence among them, to bring them to ſaluation. When God would preſerue <hi>Moſes</hi> out of the waters that might haue drowned him, hee ſent <note n="m" place="margin">Exod. 2, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter to the Riuer, to take vppe the Childe, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for it, who brought him vp at her owne coſt. So when God will ſaue a people from their ſinnes, and make them partakers of his Kingdome, hee offereth vnto them the meanes, he ſendeth his word, he giueth guiftes vnto his Miniſters, hee toucheth their hearts with a Conſcience of their duties, and cauſeth them to preach vnto them, that ſo they might be conuerted and ſaued. If God haue thus bleſſed vs, and beſtowed this mercy vpon vs, which he hath denied to many places and perſons, <note n="n" place="margin">Amos 4, 7.</note> cauſing it <hi>to raine vpon one Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and not vpon another Cittie, ſo that one peece was rained vppon, and the peece vvhereupon it rained not, vvithered.</hi> Let vs therefore acknowledge this
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:7222:122" rendition="simple:additions"/> goodneſſe, and walke worthy of this benefit, leaſt the Goſpell bee remoued from vs, and giuen vnto another Nation, that will bring forth the fruites of it. When the Goſpell was offered vnto the Iewes, <note n="o" place="margin">Acts 18, 6.</note> and they reſiſted &amp; blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed, the Apoſtle ſhooke his raiment, and ſaide vnto them; <hi>Your blood be vpon your owne head, I am cleane, from henceforth will I go vnto the Gentiles.</hi> It had beene better for vs we had neuer had the word preached among vs, then to haue it offred, and we not regard it. It ſhall bee eaſier for the Turkes and Sarazens in the day of judgement, then for vs; for if they ſhall be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that neuer had the truth of God among them, and knewe not what the preaching of it meaneth; much more iuſtly ſhall we periſh, that haue had the Goſpell taught in our ſtreets, and brought vnto our doores, and Chriſt Ieſus deſcribed in our ſight and among vs crucified. Let vs therefore take heede that the Goſpell be not the ſauour of death to death vnto vs, and that Chriſt be not a rocke of offence to ſtumble at, leaſt if we fall on him, he grind vs to peeces, and to powder.</p>

It is his dutie to be well ſtudied in the word of God, &amp; to exerciſe himſelfe carefully in the reading thereof, that he may be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the ſame vnto the people. He muſt be as a plentifull Store-houſe of all neceſſary prouiſion, that they may reſort to him, and ſeeke the Lawe at his mouth: For how ſhall he be able to teach another, that which hee himſelfe hath not learned? Or how ſhall he deliuer that which himſelfe neuer recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued?

This is it which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth, <note n="ſ" place="margin">1 Pet. 5, 2, 3, 4</note>

Neither is it ſufficient for the Miniſters diſcharge, if he teach ſildom, or now and then, as at euery quarter day when he commeth to reckon with them, or once a month to auoide the Law, but he muſt watch, and teach, and feede his flocke continually, <note n="t" place="margin">2 Tim. 4, 1, 2</note>

It is not left to their owne choiſe whether they wil hear or not, no more then it is to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Miniſter whether he will preach or not. It is required of them, that they reuerence them, obey their Doctrine, loue them, prouide for them, pray for them, and in al things eſteeme of them as the meſſengers of Chriſt, as the Miniſters of the word, &amp; as the ouerſeers of the Church, yea it ſtandeth them vpon, to heare the word at their mouths, to account of it as the meanes of their ſaluation. It is great ignorance &amp; impiety to deſire any other means to haue faith, then that which he hath appointed for vs. It is the great mercy and goodneſſe of God to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point mortal men ſubiect to ſin and al infirmities as we are, at whoſe handes we may be fed, at whoſe mouths we may be taught, and with whom we may talke familiarly, and yet by their ſimple Miniſtry may haue as good aſſurance of ſaluation in this life, and of glory in the life to come, as if the Lorde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſhould ſpeake from heauen. For, the word of God is as the gate of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and hee hath committed the Keyes thereof to his faithfull Stewardes, <note n="c" place="margin">Math. 16, 19</note> 
                  <hi>That whatſoeuer they binde on earth, ſhould be bound in heauen; and whatſoeuer they looſe on earth, ſhould be looſed in heauen.</hi> True it is, many fooliſh &amp; faithleſſe
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:7222:123"/> men perſwade themſelues, that they ſhould repent and beleeue the Goſpell, if they might heare God himſelfe ſpeake, or if one came from the dead to tell them what they ſhould do to be ſaued. When <hi>Caine</hi> had conceiued malice and murther in his heart, and intended to kill his Brother, <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 4, 6.</note> the Lorde ſpake vnto him, ſet his ſinnes in order before him, and threatned iudgment againſt him vnleſſe he repented; but did hee repent at the voice of God, and turne vnto him with all his heart? <hi>No, he fell from euill to worſe, and added one ſinne vnto another, till he had filled vp the meaſure of them.</hi> All the Iſraelites heard the Law of God in the wilderneſſe, and ſaw his wonderfull workes that hee ſhewed among them, yet they beleeued not, neither ceaſed to murmure and rebell againſt him. <hi>Iudas</hi> one of the twelue was reprooued of Chriſt for his treaſon; ſo were the Scribes and Phariſees for their hypocriſie, yet none of them repented, or at the leaſt many of them repented not at his preaching vnto them; wherefore, it is not the hearing of the voice of God can giue vs repentance, it is his changing of our hearts, and renewing of vs in the inner man, that caſteth vs into a new mould, and worketh in vs a new birth. When Chriſt Ieſus was nayled vpon the Croſſe, they ſaid, <note n="e" place="margin">Math. 27, 42.</note> 
                  <hi>He ſaued others, but hee cannot ſaue himſelfe: if he be the King of Iſraell, let him now come downe from the Croſſe, and we will beleeue in him.</hi> But if he had come downe at this taunt caſt out vpon him, wold they, or could they haue beleeued? Or could Chriſt haue beene the true Meſſiah, if he had diſcended, ſeeing it was the end of his comming into the world that hee might ſuffer, <note n="f" place="margin">Eſay 53 7. Pſal. 22, 17. &amp; 69, 21.</note> and fulfill the thinges that were foretold by the Prophets? Or would they not rather haue ſaide he was ſome couzener or Coniurer, ſome Impoſtor or deceiuer, as often before they had falſely and blaſphemouſly charged him? Or had they faith in their owne power to beleeue when they would, and to receiue him to be the Sauiour of the world? Theſe carnall men do reſemble and reaſon like vnto the Scribes and Phariſees, If God would deſcend from heauen (as they wold haue Chriſt come downe from the Croſſe) then they would immediately beleeue, then they would no longer lye in their ſinnes. But if God ſhould with his dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and terrible voice ſpeake vnto vs, we were not able to appear before him, nor to abide the hearing of it, but ſhould bee ſwallowed vp with feare, and ſtand amazed as dead men.</p>
               <p>When God ſpake vnto the Children of <hi>Iſraell</hi> in the Mount, they fledde from him, and could not endure his preſence, they ſtood a farre off, and cried vnto <hi>Moſes,</hi>

                  <hi>Talke thou with vs, and we will heare; but let not God talke with vs, leaſt we die.</hi> Shall we then in the fooliſhneſſe and pride of our own harts challenge the Lord to come foorth vnto vs, and preſume to ſettle our ſelues to enter talke and communication with him, when the earth quaketh at his voyce, and trembleth vnder him? When the Mountaines are remooued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, <note n="h" place="margin">Eſay 6, 2.</note> and the Angels couer their faces from him? If we wil not belieue the preachers of the worde, nor content our ſelues with this ordinance of God, but woulde haue eyther reuelation from Heauen, or the preſence of God, or the perſon of Chriſt, or the glorie of an Angell, or the appearaunce of the dead, or wee know not what, we ſhall neuer bee partakers of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of Chriſt, we ſhall neuer receiue to beleeue, wee ſhall neuer haue the grace of regeneration beſtowed vpon vs. God hath not left vs to the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Angelles, but to the Miniſtry of men. If we will not yeelde obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the voyce of God ſpeaking to vs in his Miniſters, wee would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard his owne immediate voyce thundring downe vppon vs, nor beleeue if a damned ſoule or ghoſt ſhal come out of hell to preach vnto vs. If we will not beleeue <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, <note n="i" place="margin">Luke 16, 31.</note> 
                  <hi>we would not beleeue, though one came vnto vs from the dead.</hi> Wherefore let vs leaue this vanity, and in a conſcience to God, and obedience to his ordinance, in a loue to our own ſouls, and deſire of our own ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, let vs euery one be ſwift to hear, ſlow to ſpeak, &amp; ſlow to wrath.</p>

               <p>Now, to the end we may heare aright, <note n="k" place="margin" type="runSum">Three things required to be good hearers of the word of God.</note> three thinges are required of vs; Preparation, Attention, and Meditation, ioyned with practiſe. Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before we heare; Attention in the time of hearing; Meditation and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, after our hearing. When Chriſt had propounded the parable of the Sower and the ſeed, in the end he gathered from thence this note, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this concluſion and admonition; <note n="l" place="margin">Luke 8, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Take heede how ye heare.</hi> For ſome preſent themſelues to the Miniſtery of the Word, for forme and faſhion, for company and cuſtome, without conſcience; others thinke it enough to bee preſent, howſoeuer they be affected in the hearing, or mooued after the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. It is therefore neceſſary that we ſhould be prepared before we come: Now to this preparation, three thinges are neceſſary; Faith, Feare, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: firſt, we muſt haue Faith, without which, the Word is as a dead Letter without life, and as an empty ſound without power: and if we doe not giue credit vnto it, <note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 6, 4, 2.</note> it cannot profit the hearers. Secondly, we muſt come with feare, that we may feare God in his word, and auoyd the breach of it. For the Lord hath <note n="n" place="margin">Eſay 66, 2.</note> reſpect vnto them that are of humble and contrite hearts, and tremble at his word. We muſt ſet our ſelues <note n="o" place="margin">Act. 10, 33.</note> in the preſence of God, and heare as if we ſaw him preſent before vs, and ſo receiue the word as from Chriſt himſelfe, the Teacher of his Church.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we muſt come with good ſtomackes, as vnto a feaſt prepared for vs, we muſt hunger and thirſt after the word to feede our empty Soules, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, and longing after it, as doth the dry ground after the Dew of heauen, and the ſhewers of Raine. This the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth; <note n="p" place="margin">1 Pet. 2, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Deſire the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Milke of the word of God, that ye may grow thereby.</hi> Hee that thinketh himſelfe full before he come to the Lords houſe, is no fit Gueſt to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his dainty fare. In hearing the word, we muſt be attentiue, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue to that which we heare. As we are preſent in bodie, ſo we muſt be preſent in minde. God opened the heart of <hi>Lydia,</hi> to attend to thoſe things that were deliuered by <hi>Paule.</hi> This is very profitable <note n="q" place="margin" type="runSum">Three bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> many waies, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as a Soueraigne remedy againſt the rouing cogitations of the minde, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the entertaining of other actions of another Nature, and againſt the loathſomneſſe and wearineſſe, that for the moſt part accompanyeth the moſt holie thinges of God. Firſt, we are ſubiect to vnconſtancy and lenity of minde, our hearts are ready to wander and goe aſtray from the preſent work in hand, and oftentimes are carried away from the beſt matters, ſo that wee neither remember where we are, nor conſider what we doe, nor endeuour to profit as we ought.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it auayleth againſt thoſe deceits and deſtructions, whereby we entertaine other actions of piety, which with-draw vs from the preſent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and duty of hearing required of vs. For ſome thinke they do God good ſeruice, when they offer vnto him no bettet then a will worſhip, which is abhominable before him. Hence it is, that many thinke it enough to be preſent with the aſſembly, and regard not how they be occupyed, ſo that whlie the Congregation is imployed one way, they are imployed another, &amp; while it performeth a publike action, they are exerciſed in ſome priuate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion: as for example, when the Church is hearing, they are praying: or when the Church is praying, they are reading. This is to offer the Sacrifice <note n="r" place="margin">Eccle. 4, 17.</note> of Fooles. For the publique actions of the Church, muſt be publikely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended of all the aſſemblie, and there is neither time nor place vnto any thing that is priuate or proper to one, or to few. For the Miniſter beeing a a publike perſon, is alwaies either the mouth of God, or the mouth of the the people: the mouth of God to ſpeake vnto vs from him, and to deliuer the word in his name; the mouth of the people and Congregation, to ſpeak vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord for vs, ſo that the action is common to the whole Church. So then, it cannot ſtand with the rules of the word, and the comely order that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:7222:124"/> God hath left to his Church, that in the time of publique prayer, of hearing the preaching, of receiuing the Sacraments, of ſinging of Pſalmes, any ſhould exerciſe and buſie themſelues otherwiſe, then as the whole aſſembly doth, in their priuate reading, or in priuate prayer, or in priuate meditation, thereby ſeuering themſelues in deuotion and action from their brethren, with whom they haue ioyned themſelues in bodily preſence. Our Sauiour Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of priuate Prayer, giueth this direction; <note n="ſ" place="margin">Math. 6, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>When thou prayeſt, enter into thy Chamber, and when thou haſt ſhut thy doore, pray vnto thy Father which is in ſecret, and thy Father which ſeeth in ſecret, ſhall reward thee openly.</hi> For it is a manifeſt contempt of the ordinance of God, a diſdaining of our Bretheren, and a diuiding of our ſelues from the Communion of Saints, to worſhip God in publique place alone by our ſelues, and it were better for vs to hearken, then to wander; and to vſe our eares then our eyes. Thirdly, this earneſt attention helpeth againſt the common diſeaſe of wearineſſe and irkeſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of hearing, whereby it falleth out, that we ſit in our Seates as men pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vpon Thornes; impatient, diſcontent, moouing hither and thither, and angry that we are detained ſo long from that which we more deſire. If wee would examine our owne hearts, how earneſt oftentimes we are, and not in following our owne vanities and idle paſtimes (to note them with no worſe Title) that we can ſpend whole daies and nights in them without tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: it might worthily make vs aſhamed, not to be able to ſtay and abide an houre or two in the houſe of God, for the increaſe of our Faith, and the furthering of our ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that we make ſuch haſt to be gone, and thinke euery minute and moment of time an houre, till we depart: we abide not the Prayer after the Sermon, to craue of God his bleſſing vpon our hearing, which as it is a neceſſary part of the Miniſters duty, ſo the people with all reuerence and humility ought to ioyne therein. For he that will not wait and ſtay to craue the bleſſing of God, dooth carry home with him to his houſe, the curſſe of God, and neuer profiteth by that which he hath heard. After our hearing, is required Meditation and practiſe of that which we haue heard, that wee may be bettered in iudgement, in knowledge, in affection. We ſhould be carefull <note n="t" place="margin">Pſal. 119, 11 24.</note> to remember it, to ponder vpon it, to lay it vp in our hearts, and to frame all our doings by it. There is a double vſe and benefit of Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It ſerueth vs againſt the negligence and ſecurity of thoſe, that hold the Word no longer in the mind, then the ſound is in the eares, and remember the inſtructions no longer, then they abide in the Church, like riuen and rotten Veſſels, that leake and let out the liquor as faſt as they receiued it. For they are no ſooner diſmiſſed, and riſen from their ſeates, but their hearts are ſtrayed, and their tongues applyed after earthly; nay, after prophane things, according to their ſeuerall affections and vaine delights.</p>
               <p>Again, it helpeth more deeply to imprint in our minds, and engraue in our memories, that Doctrine which we haue heard, and it furthereth vs in a wiſe and profitable application of euery point taught vnto our ſelues. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the beſt Scholler that thinketh often vpon his Leſſon, after he hath had it. And touching practiſe, which is the end of our hearing, preparation, attention, and meditation, Chriſt himſelfe hath ſaide; <note n="u" place="margin">Luke 11, 28. Iames 1, 22. Pſa. 119, 105</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed are they that heare the word of God, and keepe it.</hi> Likewiſe the Apoſtle <hi>Iames,</hi> pronounceth thoſe onely to be bleſſed, <hi>Which are not forgetfull hearers, but doers of the word.</hi> So then it is plaine, that the end of hearing is not vaine ſpeculation, or a bare knowledge of the will of God, but a care to obey it and performe it. For which cauſe the word is called a light for our paths, and a Lanthorne for our ſteppes, to the end we ſhould walke in it, and liue by it, and ſeeke direction from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 4.</note> Laſtly, this Doctrine giueth good direction to ſuch as haue authoritie,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:7222:124"/> either to ordaine and appoint fit perſons, or to preſent them to certaine pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For ſeeing the regeneration of man is wrought by the preaching of the Word, it teacheth the ouer-ſeers of the Church to looke to their office, and to take heede that they do not raſhly lay their hands vpon ignorant and vn-ſufficient perſons, or ſuch as are ſcandalous and looſe Liuers, and then thruſt them vpon the people to looke to their Soules, which are not worthy to feede their Cattle, or to wipe their ſhooes. The Apoſtle giueth this rule to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 
                  <note n="x" place="margin">1 Tim. 5, 22</note> 
                  <hi>Lay handes ſuddenly on no Man, neither be partaker of other mens ſinnes, keepe thy ſelfe pure.</hi> Moreouer, he would not <note n="y" place="margin">1 Tim. 3, 10</note> haue the Deacons to haue the office of attending on the poore, vnleſſe they were firſt tryed &amp; exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and after tryall approoued, let them (ſaith he) firſt be proued, then let them Miniſter, if they be found blameleſſe: therefore much rather ought the Miniſters themſelues to be proued, before they be approued, as the calling is higher, and the danger greater, if they be found vnfaithfull and vnworthy. They muſt not be carried away by friendſhip or fauour, or Letters of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, but approued onely of ſuch as are apt to teach, and vnblameable in life. The Apoſtle giueth this as an vnchangeable rule neuer to be broken, <note n="z" place="margin">1 Tim. 3, 2. 3. &amp; Tit. 1, 6, 7, 8, 9.</note>

But to paſſe this ouer, let vs come to ſuch as are Patrones, and haue the beſtowing of Church-liuings, it ſtandeth them vpon to make choyce of all Teachers, that may bring the people to Faith and repentance, leaſt it come to paſſe through their meanes that the people be vntaught, and leaſt the Prophet complaine of them, as hee did of the cheefe Rulers and Leaders after their returne from Captiuity, when eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſought their owne priuate profits and pleaſures, but had no time, or at leaſt would ſpare no leiſure to prouide for the ſetting vp of the Temple of God; <note n="a" place="margin">Hag. 1, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Is it time for your ſelues to dwell in your Fielde-houſes, and this Houſe lie waſt?</hi> This offence and abuſe, commeth from three cheefe heads, and iſſueth from three Fountaines, for it proceedeth partly from ignorance; partly from careleſneſſe; and partly from couetouſneſſe. By ignorance, when they knowe not what care is committed vnto them, and what truſt is repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in them. By negligence, when they feele not the greatneſſe of the ſinne, nor conſider the iniury offered to others, but ſuffer themſelues to be drawn and ouercome by affection, or kindred, or other mens ſuites, to beſtow ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient places vpon vn-ſufficient perſons. By couetouſneſſe, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue a portion or penſion to themſelues, and when they ſo pare it and ſhare it from the incumbent, that they ſequeſter the greateſt benefite of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice for themſelues, <note n="b" place="margin">Iudg 17.</note> and beſtow ten Shekles and a ſute of apparrell by the yeare to another, to beare the name and to ſerue the Cure. Theſe beſtow as much vpon their Horſe-keeper to keepe their Horſes; as vpon the Miniſter that hath the charge of Soules. If ignorance be the cauſe. I would in the Name of God, and in reuerence to their high places and callings, craue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to vſe a word of Exhortation vnto them, to beſeech them to giue me leaue to put them in mind, and to be content to learne how they came by this right and authority to be put into their hands. After that the bounds and limits were aſſigned to euery Pariſh, and ſeuerall Churches were appointed for ſeueral Miniſters, and Lands and liuings beſtowed for their maintenance, to the end that euery one ſhould keepe his owne, and no man to intrude vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the right of another, nor rob the Church of that which was giuen, there were certaine temporall men choſen, <note n="c" place="margin">

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:7222:125"/> priuiledges, to the end the Paſtours themſelues ſhould with more conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and leſſe incumbrance, apply their vocations. It was thought vnfit for them to follow ſuites of Law, whereby their ſtudies might be diſtracted, and ſo the people ſhould not be inſtructed: and beſides, thoſe holy men, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Chriſt, and imployed in the ſeruice of the Church, would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious in the law to ſtriue with any: whereby wee ſee they are called Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones, becauſe they were appointed by the firſt Doners, to defend the right of the Donation againſt all Intruders and Incroachers vpon their guifts, and to protect the Church-liuings from the iniuries and inſolencies of couetous and contentious men. They were not appointed by the firſt inſtitution to beſtow Church-liuings (as now they doe) but to patronize the right of the Lands conſecrated to the Church. Afterward, they were allowed to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the Miniſter, that the burthen that lay vpon them might be the better borne, and that the trouble might be eaſed with ſome honour. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they haue as men of truſt, the right of Patronage and preſentation put into their hands, and may not onely defend the place, but name the perſon, let them be carefull to diſcharge the truſt that is repoſed in them, and ſhew themſelues worthy of that power and priuiledge committed vnto them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, let them conſider that it is a great calling &amp; of great importance, and therefore great guifts are required for the execution of it.

                  <hi>Father, forgiue them, for they know not what they doe.</hi> If negligence and careleſneſſe be the cauſe of this offering of vnworthy perſons to be the Ouer-ſeers of the Church, then <note n="f" place="margin">

The Lord threatneth to the Watchman death, that warneth not his hearers, <note n="g" place="margin">Eze. 3, 17, 18</note> and ſaith, he will require their blood at his hand. If then God haue made me, or the people hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen me, or the Church hath ſuffered me to be a Patrone, I ought thus to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: If I negligently place ſuch a one, as for want of ability cannot, or for want of conſcience, wil not giue warning, and admoniſh the wicked of their ſinnes, can I want my portion in the wrath of the Lord that is threatned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ſuch defaults? Chriſt Ieſus teacheth, that it is a ſigne of loue <note n="h" place="margin">Iohn 21, 15</note> to him in the Miniſter to feede his Sheepe, to feede his Lambes: if then I bee a Patrone of any place, I muſt thinke that it is a token and witneſſe of my loue to Chriſt, if I cauſe his Sheepe and Lambes to be fed. And if it be want of loue in the Miniſter, when he doth not feede, but fleeſe the Sheepe; when he doth not teach, but ſtarue them; is it not ſo in me, if through my ſluggiſhnes and ſin it ſo come to paſſe? It is a great ſin to lay handes raſhly to admit any into the miniſtery, and thereby to giue that worthy calling to an vnworthy man: and is it no offence in me being Patrone, to beſtow the Liuing vppon ſuch a one? If he be to be blamed that giueth inſtitution and induction, hee cannot be excuſed that giueth the preſentation. It is noted by the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt; <note n="i" place="margin">Math. 9, 36.</note> that when Chriſt ſaw a great multitude of people gathered together from all quarters, he had compaſſion vpon them, becauſe they were as Sheep without a Shepheard.</p>
               <p>The word vſed in that place, is of great force, deriued of a word that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the Entrals, the Bowels, and inward parts; expreſſing thereby, as it were an aking of his head, or a yerning of his Bowels, to ſee ſo pittifull a ſight, ſo dolefull a ſpectacle. If then there belong vnto me the right of a Patronage,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:7222:125"/> and preſentation to any Liuing, I muſt thus conſider, if I be led by the Spirit of Chriſt, or haue any zeale of his glory, or care of the ſaluation of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in me. I muſt ſhew mercy and compaſſion to thoſe Soules that are ſo dearely bought and purchaſed, euen by the precious blood of Chriſt. If we haue an houſe to build, we will not admit of euery Work-man that offereth his help, or is commended to vs by others, or will labour beſt cheap: but we wil make choyce of the moſt expert and ſufficient. And ſhall we then chuſe or commend to the building of the Spirituall houſe of God, euery Cobler and Bungler, vnſufficient perſons; <note n="k" place="margin">1 Kin. 12 31</note> eyther <hi>Ieroboams</hi> Prieſtes, that were of the loweſt of the people, <note n="l" place="margin">1 Sam. 2, 17.</note> or ſuch as <hi>Elies</hi> Sonnes, who were the leudeſt of all the people?

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The meaning of the wordes.</note> This is the reaſon: the preuenting of the Obiections is in the three Verſes following, which come afterward to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>This is the order of the words, it remaineth breefly to vnfolde the meaning &amp; Interpretation of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. When he ſaith of <hi>Oneſimus; That he was in times paſt vnprofitable:</hi> he meaneth in the time of his ignorance, before his conuerſion, before his calling by the preaching of the Goſpel, and before he came to the knowledge and vnderſtanding of true Religion.

As if he ſhould ſay; If thou loueſt mee, account of him no other-wiſe then thou doſt of me, entertaine him as mine owne heart, receiue him as my Sonne, and as if hee were begotten of mine owne bowels.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Diuers pointes to be obſerued</note> In theſe two Verſes, containing two reaſons, to perſwade <hi>Philemon</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his Seruant, being made much better by his departure from him, wee are to obſerue diuers pointes, woorthy of our diligent obſeruation, and of our carefull conſideration. Firſt, we are to marke, how the Apoſtle, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the offence of <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> and of his former State before his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, doth mittigate the greatneſſe of his ſinne, by the mildeneſſe of the word. For whereas hee might haue called him, a Theefe, a Rogue, and a Runna-gate, he dooth allay it, and expreſſe it vnder a gentler Name, (as we ſhall ſee better afterward) to teach vs, that when we haue to do with Sinners that are conuerted vnto Chriſt truely, and haue repented of their ſinnes vnfainedly, we ſhould deale fauourably with them, we ſhould not racke and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:7222:127"/> ſtretch their offences, but after a ſort, couer them with the cloake of charity, and bury them in the Graue of forgetfulneſſe. Secondly, we may obſerue how the Apoſtle ſpeaking of his Conuerſion and Regeneration, doth ſet it out to the full, not onely that <hi>Philemon</hi> ſhould be perſwaded, but that <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus</hi> might be comforted. Wherefore he doth not onely ſay that he was become profitable, but very profitable, or exceeding profitable. And he addeth; not onely very profitable to <hi>Philemon,</hi> but to himſelfe, euen to them both; whereof <hi>Paule</hi> had experience already, <hi>Philemon</hi> ſhould haue heereafter: which teacheth vs to vſe all good and louing meanes, to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſuch as are newly conuerted, and to remember for their comfort and encouragement, ſuch good thinges as appeare to haue beene in them, not to diminiſh or leſſen them, but fully to expreſſe and declare them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that God may be glorified in their calling, and they themſelues may be ſtrengthned in all well doing.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie, we ſee in the ſtrength of the firſt reaſon, that men are greatly moued to doe any thing by hope of receiuing profit and commodity. It is an Argument not onely to induce prophane and vngodly men to commit wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, but to perſwade the godly and faithfull to follow holineſſe of life. Whatſoeuer is offered vnto vs vnder the Title of profit, doth carry with it a certaine force and power to lead vs to the practiſe of it: whereby we ought to learne, that in moouing men to well doing, wee may lawfully lay before them the hope of Heauen, and aſſurance of profit; yea, all men for their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter encouragement in the workes of godlineſſe, may haue reſpect to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of their labour, and the recompence of reward. True it is, the glory of God, and the diſcharge of our dutie, ought to be the principall meanes to moue vs, but the conſideration of our owne profit ſhould not be neglected. Hence it is that the Apoſtle <note n="x" place="margin">Tit. 3, 8, 9.</note> mouing all that haue beleeued, to be carefull to ſhew forth good workes, addeth; <hi>Theſe thinges are good and profitable vnto men:</hi> on the other ſide, remoouing them from fooliſh queſtions, and Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, and contentions, and brawlings about the Law: he concludeth, for they are vnprofitable and vaine. So the Apoſtle declaring the wonderfull Faith of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who refuſed to be called the Sonne of <note n="y" place="margin">Heb. 11, 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Daughter, choſe rather to ſuffer aduerſity with the people of God, and eſteemed the rebuke of Chriſt greater riches then the treaſures of <hi>Aegipt,</hi> ſheweth, that he had reſpect to the recompence of the reward.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Paules</hi> ſending is made a reaſon for <hi>Philemons</hi> receiuing, and he concludeth, that he is to bee receiued of his Maiſter, becauſe hee is ſent backe by <hi>Paule</hi> himſelfe. For ſeeing <hi>Oneſimus</hi> returned not of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, or through compulſion of others, or through danger of law, or through feare of puniſhment, but by the purpoſe and appointment of <hi>Paul,</hi> and came not againe empty, but laden with letters of commendation; it ſerueth high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſet forth the matter. To preſent himſelfe in this ſort before his Maiſter, by the direction and aduiſe of <hi>Paule,</hi> was more then if he had returned of his owne head, and it was more effectuall to mooue <hi>Philemon</hi> to receiue him: which teacheth vs, that the authour and perſwader of any iourney or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage, doth ſerue greatly to commend the iourney, and to ſet forth the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage it ſelfe; and therefore a meſſage ſent from a faithfull and good man, is not lightly to be paſſed ouer, or raſhly to bee contemned, or vnreuerently to be receiued of him to whom it is ſent.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we are to obſerue the tender and inward affection of <hi>Paul</hi> toward <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> who was as deare vnto him as his owne bowels, and therefore would haue him ſo receiued and reſpected, as hee would receiue and reſpect his owne bowels. Where we ſee, that together with his petition, he bewrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and diſcloſeth his affection toward him for whom hee maketh requeſt. This teacheth vs, partly, that to the end our requeſt and commendation may
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:7222:127"/> take place, and worke in him whom we beſeech and entreat, wee ought to ſhew our loue, and make manifeſt our deare affection for him, in the manner of making of our ſuit and ſupplication; and partly, that whoſoeuer is truelie turned vnto God, and repenteth of his ſinnes from the bottome of his heart, ought to be dearely beloued of vs; yea, albeit he were a Seruant, a Fugitiue, and one ſtained with much wickedneſſe. For a ſound conuerſion of the hart, doth blot out all reproach from the penitent, and raſeth out of our minds all remembrance of former offences, as if they had neuer beene committed. Theſe are the generall obſeruations: now let vs diſcend to the particular do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</p>

                  <q rend="inline">[<hi>Which in times paſt was to thee vnprofitable, but now very profitable, both to thee and to me.</hi>]</q> We heard before, that in theſe wordes one Argument is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, to perſwade <hi>Philemon</hi> to receiue his Seruant, which is, becauſe how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he had beene vnprofitable, now he was turned to be moſt profitable. In which Wordes the Apoſtle maketh an alluſion, to name <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> which in the originall ſignifieth profitable. It is an vſuall and common thing in the Prophets, to allude to the Names of Men and Women, of Citties and Countries, and from thence to draw ſome profitable conſideration and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that thereby they may mooue to ſome vertue, or condeme ſome vice, or giue warning of ſome iudgement, or ſet forth ſome mercy of God. The like it were eaſie to ſhew in the New-Teſtament.

               <p>This truth is farther confirmed vnto vs by ſundry examples, as by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Paule</hi> toward others, and others toward <hi>Paule.</hi> Let vs looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the example of <hi>Paule,</hi> no man is ignorant, that before his conuerſion to the true Faith of Chriſt, he was <note n="e" place="margin">1 Tim. 1, 13 1 Cor. 15, 9.

The like affection we ſee in the Iayler after his conuerſion. He had executed his office with all rigour and extreamity; <note n="f" place="margin">Actes 16, 24, 33.</note> 
                  <hi>He caſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles into the inner Priſon, und made their Feete faſt in the Stockes, becauſe hee would be more ſure of them:</hi> but immediatly after the feeling of the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, the hearing of <hi>Paule,</hi> the opening of the Priſon, the preaching of the Faith, and turning of his heart; <hi>He tooke them the ſame houre of the night and waſhed their ſtripes, and was baptized with all that belonged vnto him.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſee the fruit of his vnfained loue, after the truth of his vnfained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion. Before he ſhewed his cruelty, now he teſtifieth his Charitie; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he manifeſted his rage, now he declareth his Religion; before we heard of his fury, now we ſee his Faith.

The like we ſee in <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> he was at the firſt a Publican, a cheefe receiuer of the tribute, and a cheefe deceiuer of the people, he had robbed many by falſe accuſations, <note n="h" place="margin">Luke 19, 2, 7, 8.</note> ſo that he was growne rich, and by his Riches, into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and hatred: but when Chriſt had reueiled himſelfe vnto him, he ſtood forth and ſaide vnto the Lord: <hi>Behold, Lord, halfe my goods I giue vnto the poore, and if I haue taken from any man by forged cauillation, I reſtore him foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</hi>

By him our bondage is turned into freedome, our beggery into riches, out thraldome into liberty, our death into life. Who is it then can be ſo ſimple or ignorant, to affirme that profeſſion to be without gaine and profit, that bringeth Chriſt Ieſus with it, in whom all treaſures are hid and had? Or who can be ſo ſottiſh or ſenceleſſe to deny, that when wee haue done all that we can, our meanes are too ſlender, our coſt too ſmal, our time too ſhort, and our labour too little, in ſeeking to finde him, and in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and deluing after him. For if we finde him, we are ſure to find al things, and to want nothing that is good. What thing can be more profitable then that which giueth a man iuſt Title to Gods bleſsings, and a ſanctified vſe of his creatures? The vngodly man that is not conuerted to God, but peruerted in all his wayes, hath no part or intereſt in the promiſes and mercies of God, to warme himſelfe with his wooll, to feede himſelfe with his meate: <note n="y" place="margin">Pſal. 50, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>For all the Beaſts of the Forreſts are his, and the beaſts on a thouſand Mountaines.</hi> Such as are wicked perſons, are wrongfull Vſurpers, and vniuſt intruders vppon the Lords goods, and the portion that he hath prepared for his owne people, nay they are ſhamefull Theeues, and ſhameleſſe Robbers that ſteal from the godly, that which was created for them, beſtowed vpon them, and ſanctified vnto them. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle ſaith, <note n="z" place="margin">Titus 1, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Vnto the pure are all thinges pure, but vnto them that are defiled and vnbeleeuing, is nothing pure, but euen their minds and conſciences are defiled.</hi> In <hi>Adam</hi> we haue loſt the pure and free vſe of the creatures of God; in Chriſt Ieſus the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 1, 2.</note> heyre of al things, we recouer our Title vnto them againe. Now, that which putteth vs in poſſeſsion, and bringeth the full fruition with freedome of conſcience, and comfort of heart of all theſe things, muſt needs be holden moſt helpefull and profitable vnto vs in this life.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, if wee conſider the enduring and continuing of the gaine of godlineſſe, we ſhall finde the price of it to be aboue all other commodities: the ſweetneſſe whereof may delight vs, and the contentment thereof may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie vs, and the certainty thereof, may allure vs to the ſeeking and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it before all other, and to trauell and trafficke for it farre and neere. What commodity canſt thou name or remember, that the richeſt Marchants bring from ſtrange Countries, which is not ſubiect to be loſt by land, and to periſh by the Sea, by ſtormes, by robbers, by rouers, by tempeſtes and ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke, ſo that when thou haſt fetched it with the greateſt danger of thy life, it may be taken from thee, and thou from it, which maketh it to bee but a ſhadow of true gaine? But the profit of godlineſſe is of a contrary Nature, if once we haue gotten this Pearle, the Theefe cannot ſteale it, the moth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not corrupt it, the Sea cannot drown it, the ruſt cannot fret it, the Land can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not looſe it, the length of time cannot conſume it, the greatneſſe of danger cannot take it from vs; the vnfaithfulneſſe of ſeruaunts, the ſubtlety of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the fraud of falſe Brethren, the force of the mighty, the violence of the Oppreſſor, the partiality of the Iudge, the wreſting of the Lawe, can neuer depriue vs or debarre vs of this benefite; yea, <note n="b" place="margin">

To conclude therefore, ſo often as wee thinke of true Religion, or remember the day of our conuerſion, we muſt think with our ſelues, that we made the moſt bleſſed change that euer was made, and hold this for a firme and ſure principle, that no gaine is like to this gaine, no profit like to this profit.</p>

To this purpoſe, the Apoſtle ſetteth this downe as a certain ſigne of our adoption, that God accepteth vs as his ſonnes and daughters, to wit; our loue to the Saints, <note n="e" place="margin">1 Ioh. 3, 14</note> 
                  <hi>We know that we are tranſlated from death to life, becauſe we loue the Brethren.</hi> Euery one muſt be able to ſhew the ſoundneſſe of his faith, and the truth of his conuerſion, by the fruits of his calling, <note n="f" place="margin">Math. 3, 8.</note> and by the workes of regeneration and amendment of life. An iniurious man, that loueth himſelfe, but not another, that hath no care to doe good to his Brother, but to himſelfe onely, is not yet truely conuerted to God, nor deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from the bondage of ſinne, nor made a member of Chriſt, nor engraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the true Church, nor endued with the grace of ſanctification; he is yet in the fleſh, and not in the ſpirit; he is yet in death, not reſtored to life; he is the bondſlaue of Sathan, not brought into the liberty of the ſonnes of God. For where there is no change in conuerſation, there can bee no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of true conuerſion.</p>
               <p>The meditation of this point, muſt enter deeply into our harts, &amp; teach vs to try our ſelus, whether as yet we born again by water and the ſpirit, or not. Whoſoeuer can ſay thus, I haue beene in bondage to ſin, now I am ſet free; I haue beene the priſoner of Satan, now I am at liberty; I haue liued vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably to God, vnprofitably to my ſelfe, vnprofitably to others, now I haue learned to lead my life to the honour of God, to the benefite of my brethren, and to the comfort of mine owne ſoule; whoſoeuer (I ſay) can ſay thus, may be aſſured of his conuerſion and turning vnto God, and that God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun his good worke in him, which hee will finiſh at the appearance of Ieſus Chriſt. Let vs all therefore know and conſider, that it is required of vs to repent of ſinnes, to turne to God, to chaunge our hearts, and to amend our liues, that ſo we may bring forth the fruits of righteouſneſſe, and expreſſe our obedience to the Goſpell. To be without the fruits of the Goſpel, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the Goſpell; and to be without godlineſſe of conuerſation, is to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

It had beene better for vs that we had neuer had the Goſpell offered vnto vs, then to haue it, &amp; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne it: It had beene better we had alwayes remained in darkneſſe, then to haue light come among vs, and not to walke in the light.

               <p>Many ſtand in the midway, and haue not proceeded to learne and practiſe thoſe duties. We muſt hate all ignorance of God and of his word, which is the Mother and Miſtris of all ſinne and error: we muſt loue and embrace the knowledge of God reuealed and offered vnto vs from time to time: we muſt ſeeke after it as a Treaſure, wee muſt receiue it, otherwiſe wee deceiue our ſelues. We muſt hunger and thirſt after the ſincere milke of Gods word, and account their feete beuatifull, that bring it vnto vs, we muſt ſay; <hi>Come, let vs go vp to the houſe of God, that he may teach vs his wayes, and that we may walke in his pathes.</hi> But do we thus? Nay, when it is offered, doe we not ſpurne and kicke againſt it, as the Horſe and Mule, that is without vnderſtanding? Doe we not mocke and deride the Prophets of God, and preachers of the word, labouring to inſtruct vs in the right way, and are wee not for the moſt part made worſe, and our hearts hardned, that wee can receiue no inſtruction? If we loued the light, we would delight in it, wee would be reformed by it, we would be transformed into the obedience of it: but our prophane works do teſtify againſt vs, that we hate both the light, and thoſe that are the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and the bringers of it. I might alledge many other workes of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that ſwarme in our liues, and make vs ſwarue from the rule of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe left vnto vs in the word. If we liue in beaſtly drunkenneſſe, in vnclean luſts, in hatred, in malice, and ſuch like fruits of the fleſh, we are not yet par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of a new birth, we are not become new creatures, we haue not yet put on the new man, we cannot do good to any of our brethren. When <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was to trauell among the Heathen that knew not God among the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters that worſhipped not God, among the prophane Infidels that were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer conuerted to God, <note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 20, 11.</note> he ſaide, <hi>The feare of God is not in this place, and they will ſlay me for my wiues ſake.</hi> He could looke for no duties of loue, no prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of righteouſneſſe, no fruites of humanity toward him, to proceede from them that were vnmortifyed, vnſanctifyed, and vnregenerated. It is the great mercy of God to mankind, to giue to them his word, which reſtraineth their actions, ſubdueth their affections, and ordereth men which otherwiſe would

If therefore his word do not alter vs, nothing wil, nothing can. Thus then we ſee, that ſeeing it is the conuerſion of a man, that maketh him any way profitable or ſeruiceable to others, we muſt all labor to be born againe, otherwiſe it had bin better wee had neuer bin borne; and wee muſt ſeeke true Repentance, and the conuerſion of the heart, otherwiſe wee ſhall be vnprofitable members in the Church of God.</p>

Who is it (if he were asked the queſtion) that would be trobled with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull Wife, with ſtubborne Children, with vntruſty Seruants, or who is it that would not account them the greateſt plague and puniſhment that can befall a man in this life, to haue ſuch a diſſolute and diſordered houſe?

               <p>This was <hi>Abrahams</hi> care and Conſcience, to inſtruct ſuch as did belong vnto him, and this was the cauſe that hee had a bleſſed wife, partaker of the ſame inheritance with him, that followed him vp and downe in euerie place, as God called him; he had a faithfull <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ready in all duty to obey him; he had carefull and truſty ſeruants, that contented not themſelues with eye-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, but performed their duties in the ſingleneſſe of their hearts, as ſeruing the Lord, and not man. Would we then haue our Wiues that lye in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes, and are giuen as the deereſt and neereſt companions of our life, to be found faithfull vnto vs, of pure and chaſt conuerſation, louing their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, gouerning their houſe, and giuing no occaſion to the aduerſary, to ſpeake euill?

               <p>Moreouer, if we deſire to haue our Children the fruite of our own body, and the fry of the Church to be good and dutifull vnto vs (as euery one wold haue them do their duty to him, and will cry out againſt them when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue themſelues rudely and vnreuerently) let vs be carefull of their conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let vs giue them the ſweete taſte of Religion, and let vs teach them this trade of the feare of God. We ſee that many complaine of the hardneſſe of the world, of the ſtraitneſſe of the times, and of the miſerableneſſe of many men; Alas (ſay they) it neuer went worſe with poore men, wee know not
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:7222:131"/> what to do with our Children, how to employ them, or where to beſtowe them, except a man be able to giue a round and rich ſumme with his ſonne, he cannot get him a Maiſter, or prouide him a ſeruice, or bind him to a trade, or place him to get his liuing another day. But vnderſtand, O yee vnwiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people, and ye Fooles when will ye be wiſe? How long will wee liue in the Church, and yet not learne this one leſſon which is the foundation and fountaine of al the reſt, that godlineſſe is the greateſt gaine? Bind them to this trade, this is the beſt trade, with which no other can bee matched or compared; this requireth no great ſtocke or ſubſtance to put them foorth. They that haue nothing to giue, and little to liue vpon, may aſloon aduance and preferre their children this way, as they that haue great riches, &amp; large poſſeſſions. Hence it is that the Prophet ſaith, <note n="m" place="margin">Eſay 55, 1, 2</note> 
                  <hi>Ho, euery one that thirſteth, come ye to the Waters, and ye that haue no Siluer, come buy and eate; Come I ſay, buy Wine and Milke without Siluer, and without Money: wherefore do yee lay out Siluer, and not for Bread?

               <p>Whereby we ſee, that whoſoeuer are called to be of this Science, it wil be able to maintaine the Tradeſmen, it will bring in the greateſt profit. There are ſo many of ſome Trades, that they feare one will not bee able to liue by another, one enuyeth another, and hindereth another. It is not ſo in this Trade, the moe the better, the moe the merrier, euery one helpeth another, and all do make vp a bleſſed fellowſhip and communion of Saints. If then, thou haue a care to put thy ſonne to an Occupation, that he may learn to liue another day, and neglecteſt this which is the cheefe and ground of all, thou art greatly deceiued in thy choiſe, and Chriſt Ieſus ſhall laugh thee to ſcorn for thy folly. Let me therefore commend this waighty buſineſſe of beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy ſonne, to thy wiſe conſideration; a greater gaine I cannot name, a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher trade thou canſt not finde, a better Maiſter hee cannot ſerue, a farther freedome he cannot obtaine, a ſurer inheritance he cannot purchaſe. This is it which <hi>Salomon</hi> pointeth out vnto vs, <hi>Prou.</hi> 22, 6. <hi>Teach a childe in the trade of his way, and when he is old, he ſhall not depart from it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, if we deſire to haue our Seruants that attend vpon vs, and labour for vs, to be obedient and faithfull vnto vs, painfull in their calling, and truſty in their buſineſſe, let vs know that we our ſelues muſt be the means to procure it, and further it by ſeeking their ſaluation, and labouring earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their conuerſion. If they be truly Religious, they will be truely righteous; if they once know how to ſerue God faithfully, they will ſoone learn to ſerue vs faithfully for Conſcience ſake. Many haue euill ſeruants, and vngracious Children, they ſee it, they complaine of it, they ſeeme to lament it; but they neuer conſider that the cheefeſt fault is their owne. Haue wee Seruants or Children giuen to lying, to deceiuing, to fraude, to falſhood, to robbing and ſtealing, and breaking out into ſundry diſorders in their life? Let vs marke what the cauſe is, let vs ſee where is the occaſion, and let vs prouide howe theſe abuſes may be remedied and redreſſed. There is no better way to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them, then to teach them their duties, to ſhewe them their ſinnes out of the word of God, and to lay before them his Iudgements that are due vnto them. It is a great bleſſing of God to haue a Religious ſeruant, he bringeth the bleſſing of God with him, the heart of his Maiſter may truſt in him, and he ſhall haue no neede of ſpoile, he will do him good (and not euill) all the dayes of his life. This wee ſee in the ſeruant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who as hee had a care to teach and traine vp his houſholde in the wayes of godlineſſe, ſo the Lord bleſſed him with a faithfull family, and a <note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 24, 42.</note> religious ſeruant, whom hee employed in a waighty buſineſſe, of fetching home a Wife for his Sonne <hi>Iſaac.</hi>

               <p>Hence it is, that the Apoſtle exhorting all religious ſeruants, ſaith, <note n="r" place="margin">1 Tim. 6, 1, 2 Titus 2, 10.</note>

Thus we ſee, that religious ſeruants are the beſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, the moſt dilligent Seruants, the moſt true and truſtie Seruants, the moſt prouident and profitable Seruants, and therefore it belongeth to al Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of families, to be carefull to teach them the feare of the Lorde, and to traine them in the wayes of godlineſſe.

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</note> Let vs make vſe of this Doctrine, and ſee both what may bee learned by it, and how it may bee applyed vnto vs. Firſt of all, it teatheth, that though education bee a notable meanes of reformation and working good in the hearts of thoſe that heare inſtruction, and albeit Parents and Mayſters bee thereby diſcharged, as they that haue done their dutie, yet bare teaching is not ſufficient to conuert the ſoule, and to ſettle the Conſcience in good thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. <hi>Noah</hi> was as carefull for the inſtruction of <hi>Cham</hi> and <hi>Canaan,</hi> as of the reſt that were of his houſe, &amp; belonged to his charge: yet they followed not his Doctrine, but ſcoffed at him that was both Paſtor and Parent. <hi>Dauid</hi> a man after Gods owne heart, walked in the middeſt of his houſe, in the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe of his Conſcience; yet he had an inceſtuous <hi>Ammon,</hi> a Rebellious <hi>Abſolom,</hi> a licentious <hi>Adoniah,</hi> all of them vngodly and vngracious Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

He that laboureth in planting and wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, is nothing, except God giue the bleſsing of encreaſe. We ſee this eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in the publicke aſſembly, as well as in the priuate family; in the houſe of God, as well as in the houſe of man. There is a difference of hearers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their diuers diſpoſitions, <note n="f" place="margin">Math. 13, 13, 14.</note> ſome are deafe hearers, that haue not their eares boared through to the heart, they haue onely outward eares, and regarde no more but outward hearing, and are no way mooued with that which is ſpoken, dead-hearted, dull-eared, dim-ſighted, heauy-headed. Others, beſide their bodily eares, haue the eares of their hearts opened by the word and worke of the Spirit, made plyable and tractable to receiue, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, and beleeue, that which they heare. So is it in the priuate inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vſed in priuate Families, all that heare with the outwarde eare, are not reformed; all that are inſtructed, are not conuerted. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> What then?

Were not he a ſimple Husbandman, that would neglect to ſowe his Ground, becauſe hee knoweth that ſome of the Corne will neuer grow vppe, to bring foorth fruite, but dye in the earth? Or were not hee an vnwiſe Law-giuer, that will not haue whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Lawes enacted and eſtabliſhed, becauſe ſome tranſgreſſe them, and diſobey them, and make no account of them? Or were not hee a very foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Father, who becauſe hee hath one rude and riotous Sonne, that will not reuerence his perſon, nor fulfill his Commaundements, nor regarde his Authoritie, nor feare his threatninges, woulde therefore holde his peace, and refraine himſelfe from inſtructing and informing his other Children in the wayes of Godlineſſe? Or were hee not a badde Gardiner, who becauſe ſome of his Ground bringeth forth Weeds and Nettles, would therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to water the Hearbes that are meete for the vſe of man? When the Lorde ſent his holy Prophets to reprooue the ſtubborne and ſtiffe-necked Iewes, hee knewe what entertainement them-ſelues ſhoulde finde, and what ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect their Doctrine woulde haue taken, yet to make them without excuſe,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:7222:133"/> they were commanded to go, that they might be conuinced of ſinne, ſeeing there had beene a Prophet among them. The Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> being called of God to preach the word, is told afore-hand, that they ſhoulde not obey his word, <note n="g" place="margin">Ier. 1, 19. Ezek. 2, 5, 7. and 3, 7.</note> but fight againſt him. Likewiſe <hi>Ezekiell</hi> being ſent to the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is ſhewed that they would not heare him, nor ceaſe from their waies. Whereby we ſee, that howſoeuer the people were ſtiffe-necked, and ſtif-har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, howſoeuer their faces were ſtronger then the Flint, and their fore-heads were harder then the Adamant, yet God would haue his worde offered vnto them, and laid before them. He hath mo endes then one of the preaching of his word; ſometimes he vſeth it to ſoften, and ſometimes to harden; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſaue, and ſometimes to condemne; ſomtimes to be <note n="h" place="margin">2 Cor. 2, 16</note> the ſauor of life vnto life, and ſometimes to be the ſauor of death vnto death. So ſhould it be with all godly houſholders, howſoeuer they haue many that harbour in their houſes, &amp; are entertained within their wals, that regard not the fear of God, but pull away their ſhoulders from the ſweet yoak of God, yet they are not to ſurceaſe or wax faint and weary, but to continue the inſtruction of them &amp; the powring of water vpon the hard ſtone, proouing if God at anytime will ſoften their harts, and giue them repentance, that they may come out of the ſnares of the Deuil, of whom they are holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> captiues. We know not at what time God may work in them, and call them to a ſight of their ſinnes, and to a turning from their ſins. They may heare that in the time of their ignorance, which they may practiſe in the time of their knowledge. They may hear that Doctrine, which though it lye hid and couered, as Corn in the earth, or as fire in the aſhes a long time, and ſeeme buried in perpetuall forgetfulneſſe, yet it may afterwardes break forth as the light, and kindle in their harts as a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie flame. Thus peraduenture it might be with this <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> when he was conuerted by the Miniſtry of the Apoſtle to the Faith of Chriſt, he might cal to his remembrance many good thinges that hee had heard before, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a whit regarded nor reſpected, and now profit by that Doctrine that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had deſpiſed and derided. The Diſciples of Chriſt did not by and by receiue, nor conceiue of his preaching; but when <note n="i" place="margin">Iohn 2, 22.</note> hee was riſen againe, they remembered what hee had deliuered vnto them. So ought wee to deale toward ſuch as are committed vnto vs, let vs plant and water, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting and commending the ſucceſſe and encreaſe of all our labours vnto God.</p>

Their duty is not to forget or neglect to pray vnto God earneſtly, conſtantly, and continually, for Gods bleſſing vpon his labours in their family. For when wee haue doone our beſt endeuours, and vſed the greateſt diligence, there remaineth ſomwhat behinde to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for our Children and people, euen to wait for the encreaſe of our labors, and the worke of Gods Spirit, to ſeaſon and ſanctifie their hearts that belong vnto vs. It is not the outward worke of teaching, that can conuert the ſoule, and reforme the life. We can but ſpeake vnto the eare, it is God that ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto the heart. Hence it is, that ſome beleeue, and others blaſpheme; ſome are bettered by the word, others are made worſe by inſtruction, and become deſperate, and extreamly wicked, as the Sun that ſoftneth the wax, and hardneth the Clay. The Iewes that were fedde by the word, <note n="z" place="margin">Acts 13, 45. and 19, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>were filled with enuie, and contemned the ordinance of God offered vnto them, and ſpake euill of the way of God, and the meanes of ſaluation.</hi> So it was with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the more <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> ſpake vnto him, ſo much the more his heart was hardened. For the word, thorough the corruption of our nature, is as an Hammer that hardeneth the Anuile, as a fire that conſumeth the Stubble, and as a Raine, that bringeth vppe briars and buſhes, that are reſerued to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:7222:135"/> be burned. There is no godly Houſholder, but if he be diligent to marke the manners, and to know the behauiour of the people about him, he ſhall eſpy not onely many vnreformed in themſelues, but ſecret enemies to reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in others. So that it is their parts, to entreat God, both before and after the meanes vſed, to make them effectuall and profitable, and to deſire him to encline their hearts to practiſe and obedience. We muſt follow the example of the Husbandman, who after the ſowing of his ſeede, and Tilling of his ground, <note n="a" place="margin">Iames 5, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>looketh for the early and the latter raine to come from heauen,</hi> ſo muſt we call vpon God our Heauenly Father, to ſend a gracious raine to moyſten their hard hearts, and ſo to ſoften them, as that they may bee fit to receyue inſtruction. This the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> teacheth, <note n="b" place="margin">Ier. 31, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>I haue heard Ephraim lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thus; Thou haſt corrected me, and I was chaſtiſed as an vntamed Calfe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert thou me, and I ſhall be conuerted, for thou art the Lord my God.</hi> And in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place the Church ſaith, <note n="c" place="margin">Lamen. 5, 21</note>

               <p>Moreouer, this ſerueth to comfort all faithfull Parents, and godly May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who haue with a good conſcience beene carefull to diſcharge their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to reforme their families, albeit many remaine obſtinate, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſetled in the Dregges of their ſinnes. It is vnpoſsible for the <note n="d" place="margin">Ier. 13, 23.</note> blacke Moore to change his skin, and the Leopard his ſpots; it is hard for them to do good, that are accuſtomed to do euill. Our labour ſhall not bee in vaine to our ſelues, albeit it be in vaine to others; our worke ſhall return into our owne boſome, albeit it will not enter into the boſome and breaſt of others. This is it which Chriſt our Sauiour ſaide to his Diſciples, whom he ſent vnto the loſt Sheepe of the houſe of <hi>Iſraell, When</hi>

When the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> bringeth in the Lord Ieſus, complaining that his preaching tooke none effect among the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull people of his owne hard-hearted Nation, hee comforteth himſelfe in this aſſurance, that he knew his labors ſhould not be in vain in the Lord, <note n="f" place="margin">Eſay 49, 4.</note>

For, as when we come into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the faithfull, we ought to bee prepared and fitted to receiue the ſpirituall food of our ſoules; ſo in comming to the priuate exerciſes of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing &amp; inſtruction, we are not to preſent our ſelues raſhly and vnreuently, as if wee went to heare a Play, or to ſee ſome paſtime, or to diſpatch ſome

                  <hi>That there ſhall be condemnation mercileſſe, to him that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not mercy, and mercy reioyceth againſt condemnation.</hi> This we ſee in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of that euill Seruant that fell from his Maiſters fauour, and was deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forgiueneſſe. For when as being vnable to pay, <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 18, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.</note> 
                  <hi>He cryed for mercy, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forbearance and promiſed payment, his Maiſter had compaſſion vpon him, looſed him, and forgaue him the debt. But when that Seruant dealt hardly with his Fellow-Seruant that ought him an hundred pence, ſo that he laid handes vpon him, tooke him by the throat, and caſt him into Priſon, his Lorde called backe his grant, and required the debt of him, and deliuered him to the Tormentours.</hi> This may ſeeme very ſtrange at the firſt, that his Lorde ſhould forgiue the Debter, yet and afterward exact the debt of him: to pardon the offence, and to punniſh the offender. This may ſeeme all one, as if a Magiſtrate ſhould remit the theft, and execute the Theefe. But we ſhall not greatly maruaile at this dealing, if we conſider that God giueth pardon vpon condition, and that we receiue pardon vpon condition. True it is, this condition is not alwaies or heere in this place expreſſed, but it is here and alwaies to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. Notwithſtanding, ſometimes the condition is added, as when Chriſt ſaith; <hi>Condemne not, and ye ſhall not be condemned: forgiue, and ye ſhall be forgiuen. Luke</hi> 6. So that he forgiueth vs our offences, condicionally that we forgiue the offences of our Brethren. Thus he forgaue the Seruant that was not able to pay, to teach him compaſſion and mercy toward thoſe that were indebted vnto him. If we will not forgiue, but require of our debters the vtmoſt farthing, we ſhall finde the Lord as hard, and our ſelues to make a Law againſt our ſelues. Wherefore, to the end that Gods example may be followed in well doing, that our owne conſciences may be aſſured of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe, and that great danger is incurred through want of forgiueneſſe: we learne, that God requireth it as a ſpeciall duty of vs, to ſhew our ſelues ready and forward to forgiue our Bretheren, that haue wronged and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection 1.</note> Firſt, ſeeing we are bound to forgiue euery one that is indebted vnto vs, the queſtion may be asked whether, this extend to all debts, and that we are charged to forgiue all our Debters? <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> I anſwere, debts are of two ſorts, either Ciuill, which commeth by Couenants of buying and bargaining one with another, without which, the life of man cannot conſiſt. Of theſe mutuall Couenants and Contracts betweene man and man, we muſt not vnderſtand our Sauiour Chriſt when he ſpeaketh of Debts and Debters: but of priuate hurts and damages that are done vnto vs, in our bodies, in our goods, or in our good Names. Theſe iniuries done to our bodies, which oftentimes are miſvſed; to our goods which are diminiſhed, to our good Names which are impaired, are to be remitted. As for other debts due to vs, we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them, ſo we doe it with ſhewing mercy to ſuch as are in neceſſity, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward whom we ought to haue patience in forbearing.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection 2.</note> The ſecond is, whether a man may lawfully ſue him at the Law that hath offended him? Or how doth ſuing and forgiuing ſtand together in a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an? <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> I anſwer, the Law is free for all men, and the end of it is to redreſſe all diſorders. And as a Souldier in a lawfull warre may kill his Enemy, and yet loue him: ſo may a man forgiue an iniury, and yet vſe the remedy of the Law, and thereby ſeeke in a Chriſtian manner, to redreſſe the wronges that are done vnto him. Now, in ſuing at the Law, we muſt obſerue theſe ſixe rules. Firſt, it muſt not be for toyes and trifles, but in matters of waite and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which do neerely concerne vs, and whereby we are ſome way damni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. But trifles cannot damnifie vs. This reproueth thoſe that are ſo farre carried vpon the ſpleene, <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 6, 7.</note> as that they are ready to proſecute euery action and ſlight occaſion that is offered vnto them, if it be but the wagging of a Straw, which bewrayeth an euill heart in them. Secondly, we muſt take heede of priuate reuenge and inward hatred, which if we conceiue, we doe not forgiue. We muſt not ſuffer our ſuites to coole our loue to our Bretheren, nor to weaken our Faith in performing our ſeruice &amp; worſhip vnto God. For albeit the cauſe be neuer ſo iuſt and lawfull, <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 12, 9, 10.</note> yet if we handle it vnlawfully, vncharitably, and vnchriſtianly, we offend God, and tranſgreſſe againſt our Brother. Thirdly, we muſt beware of giuing offence to the Church of God. Some offences are taken, but not giuen, as when men are offended for doing our duty to God. We muſt not omit that which God requireth, becauſe man will be offended. Our care muſt be, to be ready to giue ſatisfaction to the godly, that our doing be not iuſtly ſcandalous, obſeruing the rule of the Apoſtle; <note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 10, 32 1 Theſ. 5, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Giue no offence, neither to the Iew, nor to the Gentile, nor to the church of God, and abſtaine from all appearance of euill.</hi> Fourthly, the end of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies and Suites in Law, muſt bee to liue in concord, and to maintaine godly peace. If we haue not this end, we ayme at a wrong end. The end of all lawfull Warre, is not murther and tumults, but peace and quietneſſe. So the end of all ſtrife, muſt be to liue without ſtrife. For if all iniuries were put vp and were not repreſſed, many would grow worſe and worſe, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne the Ciuill State and gouernment.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, another end we may at, muſt be, that the truth may come to light that is hidden, that the party offending may be chaſtiſed, <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 6, 11.</note> and by chaſtice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be brought to repentance for his wronges. For ſuch is the mallice of many, that the paſſing by of one wrong, would but open a wide gap or gate to bring other iniuries vpon our owne heades: and the more we ſuffer, the more hard meaſure they would offer. Laſtly, the Law muſt bee vſed, not vpon pleaſure, but vpon neceſſity, and we muſt take it vp as the laſt refuge and remedy. We muſt vſe it as a Father vſeth correction, or as a Phyſition v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth deſperate Medicines, or as the Surgion vſeth ſearing and cutting, <note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 6, 6.</note> when
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:7222:137"/> other will not ſerue the turne. If a friendly agreement and priuate arbiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be had, let it be preferred, and the Magiſtrate not troubled with our contentions. Thou oughteſt not to produce into publike Courts of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and iudgement, that which may well bee decided and determined by graue, ſober, godly, and diſcreet men at home, as the ſmall cauſes which the Rulers might iudge, were not to be brought before <hi>Moſes. Exod.</hi> 18, 22. If it cannot be had, ſo that though we ſeeke peace and enſue it, yet it flyeth from vs, it is lawfull for vs to go farther, euen to ſue our neghbour at the law, and vſe the benefit of the Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection 3.</note> The third obiection is, how can the Magiſtrate practiſe this Doctrine to forgiue offences and offenders, ſeeing (as the Apoſtle teacherh.) Rom. 13. <hi>He beareth not the Sword in vaine?</hi> If his duty be to puniſh, how can he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don? If he be to execute iudgement, how can he forgiue them that treſpaſſe? <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> I anſwere, a Magiſtrate is to be conſidered two waies, according to two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall perſons which he doth ſuſtaine; to wit, either as he is a Man, or as hee is a Magiſtrate, as he hath a common condition, or a ſpeciall. As he is a man, or a Chriſtian man (which eſtate he hath common with his Brethren) he is to beare and forbeare, and behaue himſelfe as others: but as he is a Magiſtrate, which eſtate he hath as properlie belonging vnto him; he is the Deputy and Vice-gerent of God, he ſuſtaineth his perſon, he executeth his iudgement; and therefore he ought not to haue any reſpect of perſons, or winke at the committing of any wickedneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection 4</note> The fourth Obiection, is, how we can be ſaide to forgiue our Bretheren their treſpaſſes, ſeeing no man can forgiue ſinnes but onely God. Hence it is that <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith in the Pſalme; <hi>Against thee, againſt thee onely haue I ſinned, and done euill in thy ſight.</hi> Pſal. 51. Likewiſe the Scribes and Phariſies, when they heard Chriſt ſpeake to the man ſicke of the Palſie; <hi>Thy ſinnes are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thee,</hi> began to reaſon among themſelues, <hi>Who is this that ſpeaketh Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? Who can forgiue ſinnes but God onely?</hi> Luke 5, 20, 21. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> I anſwer, in euery ſinne there are two things to be marked and conſidered; the euill of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the damage that ariſeth to man by the euill action: the one God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueth; the other man forgiueth. God pardoneth the euill; Man pardonerh the damage or detriment that befalleth his perſon, goods, or name. So then God forgiueth, and Man forgiueth: God forgiueth the ſinne, man forgiueth the hurt. For we muſt obſerue, that in euery treſpaſſe are two offences; one to God; the other to man. To God, when he forgiueth the breach of his law, and imputeth it not to the offender which belongeth properlie to him, and no man is able to doe. To man, when he remitteth the iniury or harme that hath riſen to him, in the things that appertaine to him. It is not in mans po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to forgiue the ſinne, whereby God is offended: and he oftentimes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth the wrong done to him, when God forgiueth not the ſinne: for God neuer forgiueth any, but ſuch as are penitent.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection 5.</note> Laſtly, the queſtion may be asked, whether all offenders againſt vs are to be forgiuen, or onely ſuch as repent. The Apoſtle moueth <hi>Philemon</hi> to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his Fugitiue and falſe-fingred Seruant vpon his repentance. So Chriſt our Sauiour ſpeaketh to his Diſciples: <note n="g" place="margin">Luk. 17, 3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Take heede to your</hi> ſelues, <hi>if thy Brother trespaſſe againſt thee, rebuke him: and if he repent, forgiue him: And though he ſinne againſt thee ſeauen times in a day, and ſeauen times in a day turne againe to thee, ſaying; It repenteth me, thou ſhalt forgiue him.</hi> Whereby it may ſeeme at the firſt, that eyther we are onely to forgiue the penitent, and retain mallice againſt the impenitent, which were want of Charity: or ſay, that the condition annexed by Chriſt, is voide and idle, which were a voyce of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> I anſwere, offences are forgiuen two waies, as there are two kind of perſons that offend againſt vs. Some acknowledge and yeild their offence, others are obſtinate and ſtiffe-necked. So, one kind of forgiueneſſe is, when
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:7222:138" rendition="simple:additions"/> we beare no mallice, when we doe no wrong, when we ſeeke no reuenge. Another kind, is; when we thinke well of them that haue offended vs, when we are perſwaded that God hath forgiuen them, when wee are ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them into our fauour againe. Wherefore we haue no liberty granted vnto vs to deny mercy and forgiueneſſe to the wicked. If a man haue done vs wrong, and then either denyeth it, or diminiſheth it, and will not repent of it: True it is, we are commaunded to loue him, we are forbidden to hate or to hurt him, we are reſtrained from reuenge, we are brideled from wiſhing or deſiring vengeance to fall from Heauen vpon him, we are charged to do him good and not euill, we are willed to procure his ſaluation, to ſeeke his amendment, and to further his repentance that he may ſee his ſin; but we are not bound nor bidden to haue a good opinion and eſtimation of him; for though we muſt loue him, yet we muſt thinke of him as he deſerueth. But when a man hath offended vs, and treſpaſſed againſt vs, and being reproued and admoniſhed confeſſeth his ſinne, deſireth pardon, craueth reconciliation, offereth ſatisfaction, bewaileth his former tranſgreſſion, and promiſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of life, it is our dutie not onely to loue him, but to like of him: not onely to hate him as an Enemy, but to account him as a Brother: not only to deſire vengeance to come vpon him, but to accept of his repentance, and to aſſure his heart that God hath forgiuen him, and will not lay his ſinne vnto his charge. So then, if any man doe me an open iniury, and I laying aſide a thirſting after reuenge, <note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Calui. harm. in Euangel.</hi>
                  </note> doe not ceaſe to loue him, but in ſtead of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill doe good, and in ſtead of wrong, do beſtow a benefit vpon him, though in regard of the wickedneſſe of his heart, the miſchiefe of his hands, the want of repentance, and the nature of his offence, I thinke hardly and heynouſly of him (as he is worthy) yet am I truely ſaid and rightly accounted, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue him. For when God requireth that we doe good to our Enemies, loue them that hate vs, bleſſe them that hurt vs, pray for them that perſecute vs, and to doe good to all them that ſpeake all euill againſt vs: he doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by preſently commaund that we allow in them thoſe things that he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, or praiſe in them the thinges that he reprooueth: but he onely would haue our hearts free from hatred, our minds from mallice, our tongues from ſlander, &amp; our hands from reuenge. The ſecond manner of forgiuenes (which is a free and full forgiueneſſe) is, when beholding liuely fruits of their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, we eſteem them as brethren, we account them as the children of God, we fauour the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as fellow-members with vs of Chriſt, &amp; are perſwaded that the remembrance of their ſins co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted againſt God, and of their iniuries offered vnto vs, are blotted out of Gods ſight. For true repentance is an high and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worke, greatly accepted of God and his Angels. Of God, <note n="i" place="margin">Ezek. 18, 22.</note> becauſe when we repent, he will put all our ſinnes out of his remembrance. Of the <note n="k" place="margin">Luke 15, 7, 10.</note> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, becauſe there is ioy in their preſence for one Sinner that conuerteth, more then for ninety and nine iuſt men that neede no repentance. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of that which hath beene ſaide, is this: If an offender haue wronged thee, and continue obſtinate and ſetled to wrong thee ſtill, thou ſhalt forgiue him, that is; thou ſhalt not hurt him, nor mallice him, but loue him, and ſeek to doe him good: but as yet thou art to think him a wilfull and wicked man, <note n="l" place="margin">Eſay 5, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe thou art not to ſpeake euill of good, or good of euill; to put darkeneſſe for light, and light for darkeneſſe; to call bitter ſweete, and ſweete ſower.</hi> If he turne from his euill waies, and repent him of his ſinnes, thou ſhalt forgiue, him, that is; thinke as well of him, as euer thou didſt thinke ill of him, comfort him, raiſe him vp with the ſweete promiſes of the Goſpell, and aſſure him that God hath forgiuen him, &amp; therfore he need not doubt of the forgiuenes of his Fellow-Seruant. And if we will a little ſearch the Scriptures, we ſhal finde examples of both theſe ſorts and kindes of forgiueneſſe recorded vnto vs. Of the firſt ſort of forgiuing euill doers, euen while they remaine euill
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:7222:138"/> doers, we haue in <hi>Dauid</hi> toward <hi>Shemei,</hi> that curſſed him with an horrible Curſſe, he ſware that he ſhould not dye, and pardoneth him (albeit <hi>Abiſhai.</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Zeruiah</hi> ſaid; <note n="m" place="margin">2.

                  <hi>And ſuch Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as is not named without deteſtation among the Gentiles, taking vnto him his Fathers Wife.</hi> For when he being rebuked of many, and put out from among them, ſorrowed for his ſinne with a godly ſorrow, which cauſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance not to be repented off, he willeth them to receiue him, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine him among them as a faithfull Brother, and to thinke well of him as they did before, <note n="p" place="margin">2 Cor. 2, 7, 11</note>

Firſt, ſeeing former offences are vpon our repentance to be forgiuen, we learne that we ought all to be of a plakeable Nature, eaſie to be appeaſed, and ready to be intreated; we muſt be inclinable to mercie, and paſſe by offences that might prouoke vs to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.

It is a great comfort to the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our Faith, which needeth all proppes and pillers to ſuſtaine and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it. For though the forgiueneſſe of our Brethren be no cauſe of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe, it is a ſigne and teſtimonie, whereby we are infalliblie confirmed, that as ſurely as we remit others, we ſhall be remitted. Nothing maketh vs more reſemble the Lord, then to be mercifull, hee is the God of patience, <note n="r" place="margin">Pſal. 103, 8, 9 14.</note> 
                  <hi>He is ſlow to anger, he is full of compaſſion, and of great kindneſſe, he will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way chide, neither keepe his anger for euer, he knoweth whereof we are made, and he remembreth we are but Duſt.</hi> On the other ſide, nothing in the World maketh vs ſo like vnto Sathan, and to be transformed into his Image, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and enuy.

If then wee giue our ſelues to hatred and mallice, and neuer thinke our ſelues well, but when wee are diſgorging the rank or and enuy of our boyling ſtomackes, we ſhew our ſelues not to be the Sonnes of God, who is Loue it ſelfe; but to be the Children of the Deuill, who is maliciouſneſſe it ſelfe.

So then, they are poſſeſſed with the Spirit of the Deuill, that are content to ſhake hands and promiſe forgiueneſſe, that ſpeak deceitfully euery one with his neghbor, flattering with their lips, and gloze with a double hart; yet keepe in mind the remembrance of old iniuries wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and watching for opportunity of time, place, and means, to execute the bloody deſignes of their beaſtly hearts.

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 2</note> Secondly, ſeeing ſuch as offend vs, muſt vpon their ſound repentance be forgiuen; we are taught heereby, not to reproach and vpbraid men what they haue beene, when they are renewed by amendment of life, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their preſent condition what they are. For when God hath put out of his remembrance their ſinnes, we muſt not ſet them vpon records: when GOD hath diſcharged them of them, we muſt not lay them to their charge: when God hath cured and couered them, we muſt not vncouer them, and make them bleede afreſh. Let vs remember what wee our ſelues haue beene, before we were in the State of grace, euen as euill as others, and had our delight in all ſinne. The Apoſtle ſaith. Rom. 7, 18. <note n="z" place="margin">Rom. 7, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>I know that in me, that is, in my Fleſh, dwelleth no good thing: for to will is preſent with me, but I find no meanes to performe that which is good.</hi> Likewiſe, hee forbiddeth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth the Gentiles from inſulting and triumphing ouer the Iewes, that were through infidelitie for a ſeaſon cut off: <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 11, 18, 19, 20.</note> Thou wilt ſay; <hi>The Braunches are broken off, that I might be grafted in: Well, through vnbeleefe they are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, and thou ſtandeſt by Faith: boaſt not thy ſelfe againſt the Braunches, be not high minded, but feare.</hi> It is a great reproach to vs, to reproach ſuch as haue fallen, and are riſen againe by true repentance: to vpbraid ſuch as haue ſinned, &amp; haue forſaken their ſins. It is a greater blemiſh to thoſe that check them after they haue turned from them, then to thoſe that committed them. For they haue waſhed away by their teares the filthineſſe of them, and blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out the deformity that did cleaue vnto them.</p>
               <p>True it is, ſo long as we continue in ſinne, and follow the luſtes of our owne hearts, we muſt be content to be reprooued and ſhamed for them, that ſo we may be brought to ſee them, and be ſorry for them. Thus it is noted, that Chriſt began to vpbraid the Citties, <note n="b" place="margin">Math. 11, 20,</note> 
                  <hi>Wherein moſt of his great workes were done, becauſe they repented not.</hi> So the Apoſtle feared, <note n="c" place="margin">2 Cor. 12, 21</note> 
                  <hi>Leaſt when hee came againe to the Corinthians, his God ſhould abaſe him among them, ſo that he ſhould bewaile many of them which had ſinned already, and yet repented not of the vncleaneſſe, and Fornication, and wantonneſſe which they haue committed.</hi> They then that repent nor, are to bee diſgraced: but ſuch as haue repented, are to be loued and cheriſhed. It skilleth not what they haue beene, for they are accepted according to the grace which they haue receiued, which ſerueth as a ſingular comfort vnto them. They that labour to diſgrace thoſe whom they ſhould embrace, do imitate the example and practiſe of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, who tempteth thoſe that hee ſeeth to haue renounced his ſeruice, and departed from his Kingdome, and telleth them what they haue done, how looſe they haue beene in their liues, and into what horrible ſinnes they haue fallen, that thereby hee might bring them to diſpaire, and to let goe their ſtrong confidence that they haue in the promiſes of the Goſpell. So it is with ſundry of the Seruants and Children of the Deuill, they taunt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile the faithfull, for former faults which now they hate and abhorre. But as they aunſwere Sathan, ſo they may all his Inſtruments, that they ſhould conſider rather what they are, then what they haue beene; and behold their preſent condition, not that which is paſt. Let vs be like the good Angels, who doe reioyce at the conuerſion of Sinners, but neuer caſt them in the teeth with their offences that haue ſtumbled, and are recouered.</p>

               <p>Let vs learne, that we ought no more to bee deuided aſunder, then the kingdome of Heauen can be deuided: and that whoſoeuer renteth himſelfe from his Brethren, baniſheth himſelfe from the place of glory, which we all looke for.

There are not diuers Faiths, diuers Baptiſmes, diuers Suppers, diuers Gods: but one Lord Ieſus, one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, one Faith, one Lordes Supper, one God and Father of all. All theſe thinges, <hi>Abraham</hi> (no doubt) did conſider and beleeue, and therefore ſaid; <hi>We are Brethren.</hi> He doth not ſtand vpon his reputation, and ſay; Shall I ſtoope to him?

If the leaſt occaſion of contention and iarre be offered, how ready are we to embrace it, to nouriſh it, to proſecute it with all extreamity? When we are a little mooued, are theſe the wordes of Brethren, I will not take this abuſe at his handes, I will neuer put vp this iniury, I will not be made ſuch a Noddy, I will ſue him at the Law, I will not leaue him worth a Groat, I will make Dice of his Bones, I will tread vpon his Graue: and ſhall I yeeld vnto him, I will neuer doe it.</p>
               <p>O my Brethren, is this to follow the ſteppes of faithfull <hi>Abraham,</hi> or to be like him, who was ſo wiſe, ſo meeke, ſo great a louer of peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord?

If then, we wold make it manifeſt, that we haue beene brought vp in the Schoole of Chriſt, we muſt loue one another.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 4.</note> Laſtly, ſeeing it is the ſum of the Law, and a token and teſtimonie that we make Conſcience to walk in the wayes and commandements of God. Heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto commeth the laying of the Apoſtle, <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 13, 8, 9</note> 
                  <hi>Owe nothing to any man, but to loue one another: for he that loueth another, hath fulfilled the Law. For this; Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery, Thou ſhalt not kill, Thou ſhalt not ſteale, Thou ſhalt not beare falſe witneſſe, Thou ſhalt not couet, and if there be any other commandement, it is breefely comprehended in this ſaying, euen in this; Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbor as thy ſelfe.</hi> This is a ſpeciall praiſe, and ſinguler commendation of loue, that it is a ſhort ſumme and briefe abridgement of the whole Lawe, and of euerie Commandement contained in the Law. This truth is taught in ſundry other places, and repeated againe and againe, <note n="d" place="margin">Gal. 5, 14. Coloſ. 3, 14. 1 Tim. 1, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>All the Law is fulfilled in one worde,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:7222:142"/> which is this, Thou ſhalt loue thy Neighbor as thy ſelfe.</hi> And Col. 3. <hi>Aboue all things put on loue, which is the bond of perfectneſſe.</hi> Likewiſe 1 Tim. 1, 5. <hi>The end of a commandement, is Loue out of a pure heart, and of a good Conſcience, and of Faith vnfaigned.</hi> Loue therefore comprehendeth all duties: for Charity is the Law abridged, as the Law is Charity enlarged. Loue is as it were a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Vertue, like vnto the ſoule which is ſaid to be whole, in the whole &amp; in euery part, or as the blood which is diſperſed through the whole body, ſo is loue enlarged and lengthned through all and euery vertue. Seeing then, ſuch as are conuerted by vs, are the fruit of our labour, and that Loue to the brethren is the ſeale of our ſaluation, the badge of our profeſſion, and an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitome or a breuiary of the whole Law, it followeth that it ought to be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, earneſt, and feruent, toward all the faithfull, eſpecially ſuch as haue gone aſtray, and bin brought by vs into the right way.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</note> This then being a vertue ſo neceſſary, that euery one which belongeth to the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, muſt yeeld their obedience, euen to loue the Brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and ſhew himſelfe a true Chriſtian, by ſhewing Charity to his neighbor: let vs conſider the nature and properties of this Loue, that wee may haue the right and true vſe of this Doctrine. For heere is occaſion offered vnto vs, to ſearch into the knowledge of this Vertue, which is almoſt baniſhed from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, or weeded and worne out of the world, or caried from hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wilderneſſe from the ſonnes of men, or departed vp from heauen from whence it came, and to haue quite and cleane abandoned the groſſe earth, which is vnworthy to entertaine ſo precious a Iewell any longer. Firſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs know <note n="e" place="margin" type="runSum">What Loue is.</note> what Brotherly loue is. It is a work of Gods ſpirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man is moued to affect his Brother for Gods ſake, and to ſhew forth the fruite of this affection. I call it a worke of Gods ſpirite, becauſe it is not Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally in vs, it is not borne with vs. Naturally, euery one is a louer of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and vnnaturally is an hater of his neighbour, ſo that true loue is the print of Gods finger, and a marke ſet vpon vs by his ſpirit. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle ſetting downe the fruites of the ſpirit, reckoneth vp Loue in the firſt place, as one of the principall, <note n="f" place="margin">Gal. 5, 12. Epheſ. 6, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>The fruite of the ſpirite is loue, ioy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſſe, goodneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> So then, wee want this grace, vntill God worke it in vs. We neede not ſeeke farre for ſelfe-loue, for Loue of the world, and the things that are in the world, for the Loue of pleaſures &amp; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall vanities, we haue theſe neere vnto vs, euen within vs; but we can neuer loue the godly for Gods ſake, vntill it be giuen vs from aboue, of whom on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we muſt aske it, and from whence onely we can receiue it. Againe, to be well affected toward our Brother, is to wiſh and ſeeke his good, to reioyſe at his proſperity, and to be greeued at his miſery. True loue is not ydle, <note n="g" place="margin">1 Iohn 3, 18</note> and it maketh vs that we ſhal not be vnfruitfull and vnprofitable vnto others. We muſt be ready to helpe them beare their burthen, and ſhewe the bowelles of compaſsion toward them. That loue which doeth not manifeſt it ſelfe to the releefe and helpe of his neighbor, is no true Loue, but beareth only the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of it.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is added, that we muſt doe it for Gods cauſe, becauſe God is principally and firſt to be loued with all our power, and for himſelfe. Our neighbor is to be loued in God, and for God, becauſe hee is Gods creature, and beareth his Image. For Loue extended to man is a fruite of the Loue of God. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle ſaith, <note n="h" place="margin">1 Iohn 4, 21</note> 
                  <hi>This Commaundement haue wee of him, that he that loueth God, ſhould Loue his Brother alſo.</hi> God cannot be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and our Brother hated, becauſe there is one and the ſame Law-maker, that commandeth both to loue him and our neighbor alſo. Laſtly, we muſt conſider, who is our Brother, and what is our neighbor that we muſt Loue, which are the parties to whom it is to be ſhewed. By [<hi>Brother</hi>] we are <note n="i" place="margin" type="runSum">Who is our Brother or Neighbor.</note> not onely to vnderſtand the ſonne of our Father, that is our owne blood &amp; kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred;
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:7222:142" rendition="simple:additions"/> and by [<hi>Neighbor</hi>] we muſt take heede we doe not deceiue our ſelues, reſtraining it to ſuch as are ioyned to vs in friendſhip, or neer vnto vs in dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or ſuch as beare vnto vs good will, but ſuch as are of the ſame Nature with vs, euen any of mankinde. He is to be accounted as our neighbour that is a man as we are, and doth beare the Image of God as we do, of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſo euer he be, whether he dwell neere vnto vs, or farre from vs; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be our owne Countrey-man, or a Stranger; whether he bee worthy or vnworthy; whether he be a friend or an enemy; whether he bee knowne or vnknowne; becauſe we are to conſider him in God, not in himſelfe, as we noted before. This our Sauiour teacheth in the <note n="i" place="margin">Luke 10, 29, 30, 31. Rom. 13, 8. Eſay 58, 7.</note> parable of the Samaritan, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwearing the Scribes queſtion, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. that we muſt ſhew the duties of loue to him that wanteth our helpe and releefe, though he were our enemy &amp; one that did hate vs (as the Samaritans were vnto the Iewes) whether he be god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or vngodly, we muſt extend the duties of loue toward them. Thus did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> deale toward <hi>Saul</hi> his enemy, that ſought his life to take it away: he ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him when he might haue ſlaine him, and hee cut off onely a peece of his coate, when he might as eaſily haue cut off his head; which kindneſſe of his heaped vp coales of fire vppon his head, and ſo wrought with him, <note n="k" place="margin">1 Sa. 24, 17</note> that hee called him Sonne, and prayed God to recompence vnto him that goodneſſe that he had ſhewed, and ceaſed from perſecuting of him at that time. The like example wee haue in <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 
                  <note n="l" place="margin">2 King, 6, 22, 23.</note> who woulde not ſuffer the Horſemen that were ſent to take him, to be ſmitten with the ſword, but commanded Bread and water to be ſet before them; ſo they did eate and drinke, they refreſhed themſelues, and returned to their Maiſter. Let vs follow theſe worthy preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and account all men our neighbors; let vs account our ſelues bound in dutie to help them, and do vnto them, as we would haue them deal toward vs. Thus we ſee what loue is, we haue heard from whence it commeth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it conſiſteth, and to whom it is to be ſhewed. It commeth from God, and is the worke of his ſpirit; it conſiſteth in a fellow-feeling of their good and greefe, of their proſperity and aduerſity, ſo that we ſhold reioyce with them, and mourne with them, according to the condition wherein they are; it is to be ſhewed to all ſuch as are of the ſame nature, and are couered with the ſame fleſh; that is, to all mankinde.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are to conſider the property of this Loue, <note n="m" place="margin" type="runSum">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of Loue.</note> how it is to be performed. For, as we haue ſeene the parties who are to be loued, euen al; ſo we muſt marke the manner how they are to be loued; that is, feruently, and earneſtly. This is taught by the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn,</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">1 Iohn 3, 18, 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>My little children, let vs not loue in word, neither in tongue onely, but in deede and in truth.</hi> This alſo he poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out a little before, <hi>This is the Meſſage that yee heard from the beginning, that wee ſhould Loue one another, not as Caine who was that wicked one, and ſlew his Brother.</hi> And the Apoſtle Paule ſaith, <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 12, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Let Loue be without diſſimulation.</hi> Likewiſe in the Epiſtle to the Galathians, <note n="p" place="margin">Galat. 4, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>It is a good thing to Loue earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alwayes in a good thing, and not onely when I am preſent with you.</hi> Our Loue therefore muſt not onely be true, but feruent, and that for theſe cauſes. We haue the perfect example of Chriſt, <note n="q" place="margin">Iohn 10, 11,</note> 
                  <hi>Who gaue his life for his Sheepe, and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſhamefull death of the croſſe to redeeme them.</hi> Againe, if occaſion require it, and our calling will beare it, <note n="r" place="margin">1 Iohn 3, 16.</note> we ought ſo to Loue them, as wee ſhoulde giue our liues for the brethren; which duty wee can neuer fulfill, except our Loue bee feruent. Laſtly, there are manie meanes to quench Loue, as wronges, iniuries, vnkindneſſe, vnthankfulneſſe, hatred, and emulation; all theſe corrupt affections, are as water to the fire. Seeing then, it is ſo quickely, and by ſo many meanes cooled and quenched, let vs kindle it, and labour to continue it, that it may alwayes burne, and not decay. This feruent Loue is a rare Iewell, which ſeemeth almoſt gone out of the world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we muſt know the forme and manner how wee are to Loue our
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:7222:143"/> brethren, to wit, euen as our ſelues. By this rule our practiſe muſt bee ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and by this rule ſhall our loue be iudged. As we wiſh our own good har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, ſincerely, and vnfaignedly, ſo ought we to deſire the good of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor. It is the Law of Nature that teacheth vs to doe to others, as wee would haue others do to vs. It is the Law of God that commandeth vs to Loue our neighbor as our ſelues. Our Loue muſt be without hypocriſy and diſsimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the very heart. This hearty Loue is as it were the life and ſoule of the duty due to our brethren. Let vs therefore loue them with a ſincere affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in vnfaigned ſimplicity. This appeareth plainly in ſuch as prayed for their perſecutors and vtter enemies, as <hi>Stephen</hi> when they ſtoned him, knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led downe and cried out with a lowd voyce, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Acts 7, 60.</note> 
                  <hi>Lorde lay not this ſinne to their charge.</hi> And our Sauiour Chriſt when they crucified him, ſaid, <note n="t" place="margin">Lu. 23, 33, 34</note> 
                  <hi>Father forgiue them, for they know not what they do.</hi> If we can practiſe and performe the like, wiſh their good as our owne, pray for them as for our ſelues, and deſire their forgiueneſſe, as we would be forgiuen of God, then is this true loue to our true comfort found in vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 2</note> Secondly, ſeeing this is the Loue that muſt bee found in vs towardes the Saints, it ſerueth to meet with many enormities, and to reproue manie ſinnes that raigne in the world, and are as the fore-runners of the full and finall ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine thereof. Our loue to others, is a cold loue; frozen, without heat; dead, without life; barren, without fruite; ſuch as our Sauior ſpeaketh of in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, <note n="u" place="margin">Math. 24, 12</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe iniquitie ſhall be encreaſed, the Loue of many shall be cold.</hi> But our Loue is hot toward our ſelues, we haue abundance of ſelfeloue, which ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floweth in vs, and ouercommeth true loue. This is the onely loue that remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the worlde in theſe daies, which is the corruption, nay the bane and poyſon of true loue. This is it which the Apoſtle propheſied of long agoe, <note n="x" place="margin">2 Tim. 3, 1, 2</note> 
                  <hi>This know alſo, that in the laſt dayes shall come perrillous times, for men shall be louers of their owne ſelues, without naturall affection, no louers at all of them which are good.</hi> Where we ſee, that <hi>Paul</hi> propheſying of the laſt dayes, daies of great perill, and much impiety, doth put ſelfe-loue in the firſt place, as it were in the forefront, and make it the fountaine from whence the traine floweth, that followeth afterward. For he which loueth himſelfe, will not regard what he doth to others, and arrogateth all things to himſelfe; hee ſetteth vp himſelfe as the onely man of account, he magnifyeth himſelfe, hee contemneth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Hence it is, that he is couetous, proud, treacherous, ſtubborne, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, high minded, and heapeth or hoordeth vp ſinne vpon ſinne, till he fill vp the meaſure. The worlde is peſtered with theſe Monopolies, which are all for themſelues, nothing for the common good of Church or Countrey. We haue a common Prouerbe rife in their mouthes, but more rife and ripe in the practiſe of the people, <hi>Euery one for himſelf, and God for vs all.</hi> The firſt branch ſheweth what is in vſe, but the ſecond part muſt be changed; for where eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one is for himſelfe, there the Deuill is for all. Wherefore the former is the Deuils Prouerbe, and is no more to be vſed among Gods people. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Prouerbe muſt be, <hi>Euery one for his Brother, and God for vs all:</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="margin">1 Cor. 13, 5</note> becauſe Loue ſeeketh not her owne, but the good of others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as wee ſee ſelfe-loue checked and controuled, ſo they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned that place brotherly loue in faire wordes, and gentle ſpeeches (and yet many faile in theſe, and cannot affoord them, as if euery worde of their mouth were worth Gold) whereas in ſuch is no ſound Religion, but a vizard onely of holineſſe. True loue muſt be ſhewed in the fruits, in ſuſtaining, hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, pittying, &amp; releeuing thoſe that craue our releefe, and are in neceſſity. The Apoſtle teacheth them that are deſtitute of true faith, that ſhroud them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnder the profeſſion of the Goſpell, and yet are not able to make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration thereof by their workes. A good Tree bringeth foorth good fruit. If the Tree bring forth either no fruite, or euill fruite, it is an euill tree.
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:7222:143"/> If we haue onely good words, and either no workes at all, or euil workes, it is a plaine argument, we are not yet in the number of true beleeuers, <note n="z" place="margin">Gal. 5, 6.</note> ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are endued with that faith which worketh by loue. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <note n="a" place="margin">Iam. 2, 15, 16</note> 
                  <hi>If a Brother or a Siſter be naked, and deſtitute of daily food, and one of you ſay to them, Depart in peace, warme your ſelues, and fill your bellies, notwithſtanding ye giue them not thoſe things which are needfull to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, what helpeth it? Euen ſo the Faith, if it haue no workes, is dead in it ſelfe.</hi> If then, we content our ſelues to giue the Almes of faire wordes, which are but empty ſhewes, it ſheweth that we are barren trees full of leaues, but voyd of fruite, and it ſhall miniſter as little comfort to our hearts, as it dooth releefe to their bodies. We are taught to viſit Chriſt in his members, and apply our ſelues to do them good, that in the laſt iudgement we may finde that mercie and compaſsion at the hands of Chriſt, which wee haue ſhewed to the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his body. To giue kinde words, is not that feruent loue which heere is commended vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it reproueth ſuch as giue themſelues to fraud and deceite, to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and oppreſſion, to ſubtilty and circumventing their brethren, to lying &amp; vſing falſe Waights and Meaſures. For if this ſhould be the rule of our loue, that it ought to be feruent, we ſhould examine our owne hearts whether wee would haue another man to deceiue and oppreſſe vs, by forgery &amp; falſhoode. The Apoſtle reprooueth all ſuch wrongfull and iniurious dealing, and as a Prophet of God denounceth ſeuerely certain iudgement vpon ſuch wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <note n="b" place="margin">1 Theſſ. 4, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Let no man oppreſſe or defraud his Brother in any matter: for the Lord is an auenger of all ſuch things, as we alſo haue told you before time, and teſtified.</hi> It is common and wicked Obiection. May I not do with mine owne as I liſt, who ſhall hinder me to vſe mine owne as I thinke good? This is the common ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Harlots, Drunkards, and other beaſts, which ought not to be in the mouths of Chriſtians. Let them vſe it that are out of Chriſt, let vs bee aſhamed of ſuch prophaneneſſe and ignorance. For indeed, thou haſt nothing that is thine owne; thou art but a Steward, and the time ſhall come, when thou muſt giue an account of thy Stewardſhip, becauſe thou mayſt be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Steward.</p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 3.</note> Laſtly, ſeeing all are to be loued, but eſpecially ſuch as haue bin conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by vs; it teacheth vs to further their ſaluation, that haue beene brought into the way by vs, and neuer to forſake them, vntill we haue brought them to their iournies end. For what a vaine thing were it, to finde a man wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out of his way, and going aſtray from the right path, and when he hath brought him backe, to leaue him without farther direction?

               <p>It is the part of a good Worke-man, not to leaue his worke vnperfect. A good Phyſitian will not leaue his patient, when he hath doone but halfe his cure. An Husbandman will not giue ouer when he hath halfe ſowne, but will labour vnto the end. Hee that dooth but halfe builde an houſe, is but halfe a Carpenter. He that entreth into Chriſtianity, and beginneth wel, is but halfe a Chriſtian, the greateſt part of the worke remaineth behind. Let vs all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the example of God, when he began the great worke of the Creation of

                  <hi>I am perſwaded of this ſame thing, that he that hath begunne this good worke in you, will performe it vnto the day of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> As then God neuer leaueth him whom once he loueth, ſo ſhold we haue a care of thoſe that we haue moued to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the truth, and watch ouer them for their good. The Miniſter muſt preach ſound Doctrine in loue, to the ſoules of men that he hath vndertaken the charge of, for whom he is to giue an account in the great day. Wee ſee the Apoſtles hauing taught the Gentiles, &amp; planted a Church among them, did not caſt off all care of them, nor thinke themſelues to haue diſcharged a ſufficient duty toward them, but knowing the malice of Satan, the deceit of falſe Teachers, and the frailty of mans nature, <note n="e" place="margin">Acts 14, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>They returned back to confirm them in the faith, and to ſettle them in that truth which they had receiued of them.</hi> When <hi>Peter</hi> profeſſed great loue to Chriſt, <note n="f" place="margin">Iohn 21, 15.</note> he willed him to manifeſt it by feeding of his Sheepe and Lambes: the greater his diligence was in feeding the flocke of Chriſt, ouer which hee was made a principall Watchman, the greater duty he performed to Chriſt himſelfe.

                  <hi>Almost thou perſwadeſt me to become a Chriſtian.</hi> But did <hi>Paule</hi> him ſo? Or doth hee thinke it enough to make him almoſt a Chriſtian? No, halfe a Chriſtian is no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; and almoſt godly, is not godly. Therefore his deſire was to take him by the hand, or rather by the heart, if he could haue ſounded into the depth and bottome of it, and to haue led him from <hi>Almoſt,</hi> to <hi>Altogether.</hi> Hence it is, that when he ſeeth him comming toward Chriſt, hee caſteth out his Net to catch him, if it were poſſible; ſaying vnto him, <hi>I would to God, that not onelie thou, but alſo all that heare mee to day, were both almoſt and altogether ſuch as I am, except theſe bondes.</hi> Thus he ceaſeth not continually to call vppon the Churches, to encreaſe more and more, and to proceed from grace to grace. Againe, it belongeth to euery Maiſter of the Family, to water that which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe or the Miniſter hath planted, and to be alwayes weeding out the bitter roots that ſpring vp in his Garden. If we haue brought any of his family to godlineſſe, and to embrace the Goſpell, let him make much of them, let his countenance bee toward them, let him fauour them aboue others, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh them to frequent the exerciſes of Religion, remembering that it is as great a Vertue to keepe, as to get; to preſerue, as to finde; to holde faſt, as to take.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, as it is a generall dutie belonging to all of vs, <note n="h" place="margin">Hebr. 3, 7. &amp; and 10, 24.</note> to exhort one another, while it is called to day, and ſtirre vp one another to good things; ſo if by our example of life, or lighting of them a Candle to ſee their wayes, they ſhall come to the acknowledgement of the truth, we ſhould loue them dearly, and prouoke them to go farther forward in good works, aſſuring them that ſuch as continue to the end, ſhall be ſaued. This ſerueth ſeuerely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue thoſe, who hauing beene zealous in the faith, and witneſſed a good confeſsion before many witneſſes, and beene a meanes to open the eyes of others, to behold the glorious light of the Goſpell, that before wandered in darkneſſe, are now gon back themſelues, or ſeeme to ſtand at a ſtay, <note n="i" place="margin">Reuel, 2, 4.</note> and haue left their firſt loue.

We are all naturally borne blind, &amp; haue not one eye to ſee the ſauing truth of godlineſſe: If then, we attain the ſight of our ſelues, and to knowe our naturall blindneſſe, how ought wee to praiſe Gods mercy toward vs, and to loue thoſe by whom we haue the eyes of our minds enlightned? He is a very vnkind and vnthankfull perſon, who, hauing loſt his way in a great and terrible wilderneſſe, where hee knoweth not which way to turne or returne, not whether to goe to get out, meeteth with a certaine guide that is able and ready to conduct him, and to enſtruct him in his way, wil neuer ſo much as open his mouth to giue him thankes. Or hauing beene cured and recouered from a daungerous and deſperate diſeaſe, that brought him to the doores of death, will neuer acknowledge the benefit and good turn that he hath receiued. So is it with thoſe that haue wandered a long time in the vanities of this world, and in the pleaſures of the fleſh, as in a wilderneſſe; it is the greateſt ingratitude not to acknowledge thoſe his beſt and ſureſt friends, that haue ſhewed them the ſtrait gate, and the narrow way that leadeth vnto life. And if our ſoules haue bin ſaued from death, to which we made haſt, and ranne with greedineſſe; if there bee any comfort of loue, or fellowſhip of the ſpirit, or any compaſſion and mercy in vs, we ought to ſhew it to thoſe that haue bin as ſpiritual and ſpeciall Phyſitians vnto vs, to deliuer vs from death, and to reſtore vs to life.</p>

This is conſonant to the trueth and purity of the Goſpell, this the Maiſter might well require, and this dutie the ſeruant was bounde to performe, euen to returne and repaire againe from whence he came. <note place="margin" type="runSum">

               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 1.</note> This Doctrine of the goſpel will better appeare, if we marke the reaſons. For firſt, God is not the author of confuſion and diſorder, but of peace and order. Look vpon al the creatures of God in heauen &amp; earth, on high and beneath, and we ſhalbe conſtrained to cry out with the prophet, <note n="t" place="margin">Pſal. 104, 24</note> 
                  <hi>O Lord, how manifold are thy works? In wiſedom haſt thou made them al, the earth is full of thy riches.</hi> Al tumult and ſedition, al diſorder and inſurrection commeth from the deuill, he is the author thereof. For he firſt brought in ſin, and ſin brought in diſorder. Hence it is, that the apoſtle ſaith, <note n="u" place="margin">1 Cor. 14, 33 40. Coloſ. 2, 5</note> 
                  <hi>God is not the author of confuſion, but of peace as we ſee in al the churches of the Saints.</hi> He commandeth that al things be done honeſtly, and in order; he commendeth the goodly order that is obſerued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the faithfull, and therefore he teacheth not any diſorders, nor alloweth them where they are.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 2.</note> Secondly, Chriſt came not into the world to aboliſh the Lawe, but to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh it, <note n="x" place="margin">Mat. 5, 17, 18</note> as he teſtifieth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>Thinke not that I am come to deſtroy the Law or the Prophets; I am not come to deſtroy them, but to fulfill them: for truely, I ſay vnto you, till heauen and earth periſh, one iot, or one title of the Law ſhal not eſcape, till all things be fulfilled.</hi> Now we know that the moral Law commandeth the honor of Father and Mother; that is, of all ſuperiors, who beare a part of his image. If then, the end of his comming were to ratifie the Law; then it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that the Law making a difference betweene ſuperiors and inferiors, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, and ſhall remaine in his full ſtrength, power, and vertue.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 3.</note> Thirdly, the Goſpell commaundeth hearty obedience, as vnto God, and therefore doth not diſſolue or diſanull true obedience; nay, it is a praiſe and ornament to the Goſpel, when all ſortes walke in the duties of their ſeuerall Callings, and ſpecially ſuch as are the obedience of others. Seruants are the loweſt condition in the Church, and yet the Apoſtle teacheth, that by vprigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their life, and obedience to their Maiſter for Conſcience ſake, <note n="y" place="margin">Titus 3, 10. 1 Tim. 6, 1.</note> they may adorne the Doctrine of God our Sauiour in all things; and on the other ſide, by the euil life, ſtubborneſſe, and diſobedience of ſeruants, that profeſſe the knowledge of the Goſpell, the name of God and his Doctrine is blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and euill ſpoken of. Likewiſe, ſpeaking of beleeuing Wiues, that haue vnbeleeuing Husbands, he putteth them in minde of ſubiection, to the end that by their holy conuerſion, they may winne their husbandes to embrace true Religion. To this purpoſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth ſeruants to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to them that are their Maiſters, according to the fleſh, and chargeth them <note n="z" place="margin">Col. 3, 22, 23</note> 
                  <hi>that whatſoeuer they do, they do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not to men.</hi> Seeing therefore, that God is the authour of order, not of confuſion; ſeeing Chriſt came not to aboliſh, but to eſtabliſh the Lawe; and laſtly, ſeeing the Goſpell teacheth ſubiection, and doth not releaſe or acquite any of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; it followeth, that the goſpel doth not bring in parity and equality among al (the Mother of al miſchiefe) but diſcerneth and diſtinguiſheth of the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of men; it doth not giue liberty to peruert all order, it maketh not Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to be Maiſters, and Maiſters to be ſeruants, but directeth euery one to keepe his place, and to abide in his vocation.</p>
               <p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</note> Seeing this is the honor &amp; commendation of the goſpel, let vs ſee what Vſes ariſe from the knoledge of this point. Firſt of al, we conclude from hence ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, that it hath alwaies bin a lying deuiſe, and diuelliſh ſlander to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion, to be the author and fauorer of carnal liberty, and to Chriſtian profeſſors, to be enemies to ſtates and commonwealths, to magiſtrats, lawes, &amp; ciuil ordinances. This hath alwaies bin the accuſation of ſla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous tongs, to brand
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:7222:146"/> the Goſpell, as the breeder and bringer in of all vprores and conſpiracies: &amp; yet there is no Doctrine vnder the Heauen, that leſſe deſerueth to bee defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. For the Goſpell was a friend to Princes, when Princes were enemies to the Goſpell; it teacheth to be ſubiect vnto them, to pray to God for them, &amp; to obey all their godly conſtitutions, and therefore it is the Father of lies, and enemy of al truth, that hath ſought to diſgrace &amp; diſcredit the holy truth of God, and ſuch as in truth do embrace it. Hee ſeeth and perceiueth, that if the Goſpel ſtand, his kingdome muſt fal; if the Goſpel floriſh, his kingdome muſt decay. Hence it is, that the church &amp; people of God, haue in al ages and times of the world, bin accuſed of rebellions, treaſons, ſeditions, inſurrections &amp; many other greeuous impieties Heerof the ſcripture &amp; experience affoord plentiful examples. In the book of <hi>Ezra,</hi> the enemies accuſe the guiltles <hi>Iewes</hi> 
                  <note n="z" place="margin">Ezra 4, 15. 1 King. 18, 17. Eſter 3, 6.</note> to be a rebellious people, &amp; that they haue of old bin alwaies giuen to ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Ahab</hi> burdeneth <hi>Elias,</hi> that it was he &amp; his fathers houſe that trobled <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael. Haman</hi> ſuggeſteth vnto the king againſt the <hi>Iewes,</hi> that their lawes were diuers from al people, &amp; that they did not obſerue the kings lawes, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was not for the kings profit to ſuffer them. The Apoſtles are accuſed to be authors of ſedition, troublers of cities, raiſers of tumults, cauſers of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, breakers of lawes, and teachers of ordinances not lawful to receiue, they ſaid of them, <note n="b" place="margin">Acts 16, 19, 20. and 24, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Theſe men that are Iewes trouble our City, &amp; they preach ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are not lawful for vs to receiue, neither to obſerue ſeeing we are Romans.</hi> Where we ſee, they couer their couetouſneſſe with a ſhadowe &amp; pretence of ſtanding againſt innouation, but they diſcouer the hollowneſſe &amp; hypocriſie of their harts, when they ioyn trobling of the ſtate and preaching of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell together. Whereby it appeareth, that their troubling of the city was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, but becauſe they preached the word, which the deuill &amp; his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments could not beare and abide. <hi>Paule</hi> is accuſed by <hi>Tertullus,</hi> to be a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fellow, and a moouer of ſedition among all the Iewes thoroughout the world, and that he taught al men euery where againſt the law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And no maruel, for thus they dealt with the ſon of God, when he taught the truth without mixture of error, and without reſpect of perſon, he was accounted &amp; accuſed not onely to be a Sorcerer, a Samaritan, a Drunkard, a glutton, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer, a deuil, <note n="c" place="margin">Luke 23, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>but an enemy to Caeſar, and a troubler of the publick peace.</hi> Now al theſe things being conſidered, let vs remember what the Lord Ieſus ſayth to vs, <note n="d" place="margin">Iohn 15, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſeruant is not greater then his maiſter, if they haue perſecuted me, they will alſo perſecute you.</hi> The heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after Chriſts time, cried out againſt the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that they were the authors and cauſes of al publick plagues &amp; calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that fel vpon kingdoms &amp; countries. If <hi>Nilus</hi> flowed not ouer the fields, if the heauen ſtayed, if the earth quaked, if famine encreaſed, if the peſtilence continued by and by the poor Chriſtians, as the ſheep of Chriſt, were caſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lyons.

Thus we ſee how the church hath lien open to all falſe ſurmiſes and ſuggeſtions of ſedition. But what can be immagined more vniuſt or vetrue? If there be any peace in this world in any lande, it is for the Goſpels ſake, and it commeth through the bountifulneſſe of God for his peoples ſake that call vppon him. Neuertheleſſe as the Gentiles dealt with the Iewes and Chriſtians from time to time; ſo doe the wicked in theſe dayes with the godly, they lay to their charge that they keep no lawes, that they diſobey Princes, that they are ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and tumultuous, and enemies to the State. If we ſee or heare the Saints of God thus handled, and euilly intreated, we muſt know that this is an olde deuiſe of the deuill practiſed againſt the Prophets, againſt Chriſt againſt the Apoſtles, and againſt all true Chriſtians, euen from the beginning.

                  <hi>Reſiſt not euill,</hi> which is required of al Chriſtians: What vſe then is there of the Magiſtrat, who beareth the ſword and reſiſteth euill? <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> I anſwere, Chriſt in theſe words exhorteth vs to chriſtian patience, and reproueth priuate reuenge, he doth not abrogate the Office of the Magiſtrate, as appeareth by the words of Chriſt, if they be aright conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. For he doth not ſay, if any man ſhall ſtrike thy neighbour on the right cheek, command him to turn the left alſo; neither doth he ſay if any wil ſue his neighbor at the law, &amp; take away his coat, charge and require him to deliuer his cloak alſo; but whoſoeuer ſhal giue thee a blow on the right cheek, turne thou to him the left alſo; &amp; if a man ſhal take away thy coat, let go thy cloke alſo. Wherefore it appeareth, that this concerneth priuat perſons, not publick Magiſtrates. Againe, <hi>To reſiſt euil,</hi> is not ſimply and in it ſelfe euill; but to do euill, is euil indeed. For if it were ſimply euil in it ſelfe; no houſholder among Chriſtians ſhould withſtand and reſiſt the euils of his houſe, but ſuffer them to do what they liſt, and lay the bridle in their owne necke: No Schoolemaiſter ſhall bridle the folly and licentiouſneſſe of youth, which the rod of correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth driue away; no Father ſhall bee allowed to chaſtiſe and punniſh his children, but muſt let them alone to run into al euil. If theſe things be abſurd &amp; vnworthy the perſon and doctrine of Chriſt; it followeth, that it is not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply &amp; abſolutely forbidden, to reſiſt euil.

I ſay then, that a faithfull and ſound Chriſtian, is a good Subiect, a good Father, a good Maiſter, a good Wife, a good Childe, a good Seruant, a good Common-wealths-man. The Church and Common-wealth are as louing Siſters, liuing, dwelling, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, flouriſhing, proſpering, decaying, and falling together. We muſt all conſider our common and ſpeciall calling; and know, that Chriſtian duties and Perſonall duties, muſt not be deuided the one from the other, but bee coupled and ioyned in one man. It is not ſufficient for a man in common conuerſation to be a Chriſtian, but he muſt ſhew himſelfe to be ſo in his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall calling. A Magiſtrate muſt not onely be a Chriſtian, but he muſt bee a Chriſtian Magiſtrate. A Father and Maiſter muſt not onely be Chriſtians, but they muſt be Chriſtian Fathers, and Chriſtian Maiſters.

This reproueth many that liue among vs, who beare themſelues abroad as men, forward in Religion, eatneſt in their profeſſion, and ſuch as would be accounted to goe before many others: yet take a view of them what they are priuately in their owne houſes, and what duties they performe toward their Families, they haue loſt the reputation at home that they had abroad, and ſhew themſelues to be more carefull to ſeeme religious, and to bee thought great Chriſtians, then to be good Chriſtians indeede. The like we may ſay of all Inferiours. It is not enough for the Wife, the Childe, the Seruant, the Subiect, to ſhew themſelues faithfull and religious openly in the Congregation, and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of reſort, but they muſt ſhew themſelues right Chriſtians in their reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, ſubiection, and obedience toward thoſe Superiours that are ſet ouer them.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Euery one hath two callings: generall, and perſonall.</note> Thus we ſee, that as euery one hath two callings; one generall, which is the calling of Chriſtianity, common to euery member of the the Church; the other, perſonall or particular, which is the diſcharge of ſpeciall duties, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of that diſtinction made betweene man and man: ſo both theſe callings muſt be ioyned together in our life, as the body and ſoule are in one man.

A good Chriſtian therefore cannot be an euill Subiect, an euill Seruant. If they haue Chriſt Ieſus formed in them, it will make them obey for Conſcience ſake. Nay, heereby wee ſee, that onely ſuch as feare God are good Subiects, others cannot be. For the wicked and vngodly doe prouoke God to anger; againſt the King, againſt the Kingdome, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the deſtruction of them both by their ſinnes.

This is the cheefe cauſe of the alterations of Kingdomes, and of the often mutation and changing of Kinges and Princes. For how can it be, that ſuch as are Rebels againſt God, ſhould be Frinds to Princes?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Wicked men are the greateſt breakers of Princes lawes.</note> True it is, it hath beene the ready way which the Deuill hath vſed (as wee ſhewed before) to bring ſuch as are godly and feare God, into hatred and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, by his Inſtruments; to beare the World in hand that they are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Princes. Chriſt Ieſus, though he obeyed <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and taught obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and paied poll-money, yet he was accuſed of Treaſon, and charged to be an enemy to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and condemned for it. So was <hi>Paule</hi> ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as a diſturber of the State and Common-wealth. But if we will right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider this point, we ſhall find, that theſe men that haue nothing in their mouths but obedience, and harpe vpon no ſtring ſo much as diſobedience, (as if they themſelues were made of obedience) may iuſtly be cenſured and conuinced to breake three Lawes for their one, whom they falſely and frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulently accuſe. So that we may inuert the accuſation, &amp; turne it as a wheele vpon their owne heads, and charge them iuſtly with that, wherewith they vniuſtly ouercharge others.

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:7222:148"/> ſake to be obedient to Princes: and they that haue beene found vnfaithfull to God, can neuer be iudged faithfull to men. It is well knowne and ſeene how they tranſgreſſe the Kings lawes, in their apparrell, in their meat, in their wordes, in ſlandering, in fighting, in quarrelling, in carding, in bowling, in dicing, in drunkenneſſe, in ſitting at Ale-houſes, where the Magiſtrate and Miniſter are the common Table-talke, and an hundred ſuch like inormities. As for the godly, <note n="u" place="margin" type="runSum">Onely the godly are friends to prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> though they be branded with breach of obedience, and duty to Princes, they will be found the beſt, the greateſt, the cheefeſt; nay, the onely true Friends that Princes haue. For firſt, they pray vnto God ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and heartily for their Prince, and the whole Land fareth the better for their prayers: for God heareth the Prayers of ſuch onely as heare his voyce, and loue his Lawes, and feare his Name, when they call and cry vnto him for their Prince. But he heareth not, he granteth not, he regardeth not the prayers of wicked men: for he that turneth away his eare from hearing the Law, euen his prayers ſhall be abhominable.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith; <note n="x" place="margin">Pro. 15, 8, 29 and 21, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>The Sacrifice of the wicked is abhomination to the Lord: but the prayer of the righteous is acceptable vnto him: he is farre off from the wicked, but hee heareth the Prayer of the righteous: the Sacrifice of the wicked is an ahhominaion, how much more when he bringeth it with a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked minde.</hi> So then, there can be no more vtter enemies to Princes, then ſuch as are wicked againſt God, according to the ſaying of the Wiſe-man in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place; <note n="y" place="margin">Pro. 25, 4, 5.</note>

               <p>Againe, the godly are ready to ſubiect themſelues according to Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance to Magiſtrates, their obedience is in the Lord. When lawfull things are commaunded and required at their handes, they addreſſe themſelues to doe the thinges commaunded: if vnlawfull, they ſubmit themſelues in all thinges, they reſiſt not in any thing, but ſuffer according to the pleaſure of the Magiſtrate. If then they be ſubiect with all feare, not onely to ſuch as are good and curteous, but alſo to the froward, knowing that this is thanke-worthy, when a man for conſcience ſake toward God endureth griefe, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring wrongfully: How is it, that wicked men are not aſhamed to account them as Traytors and Rebels? If it ſhould fall out, that godly Princes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund ſomething which is contrary vnto Gods word, we muſt obey <note n="z" place="margin">Actes 4, 19. and 5, 29.</note> God rather then men, but we muſt ſubmit our ſelues in well-doing vnto Princes. It is a groſſe and vnreaſonable thing to imagine, that a man in obeying God doth diſobey his Prince. This appeareth in the example of the three chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, mentioned in the Propheſie of <hi>Daniell,</hi> when the King commaunded them to fall downe before the golden Image that he had ſet vp, <note n="a" place="margin">Dan. 3, 16, 17 18. and 6, 22.</note> they anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; <hi>We are not carefull to anſwere thee in this matter: Behold, our God whom we ſerue, is able to deliuer vs from the hot fiery Furnace, and he will deliuer vs out of thy hand, ô King: but if not, be it knowne to thee, ô King, that we will not ſerue thy Gods, nor worſhip the golden Image that thou haſt ſet vp.</hi> The like we ſee in <hi>Daniell</hi> himſelfe, when he had beene throwne into the den of the Lyons, he ſaith to the King; <hi>My GOD hath ſent his Angell, and hath ſhut the Lyons mouths that they haue not hurt me: for my Iuſtice was found out before him, and vnto thee, ô King, I haue done no hurt.</hi> He had indeede broken the Kinges edict, but he accounted it no diſobedience, ſeeing therein he obeyed God.

                  <hi>Feare GOD, honor the King:</hi> where hee ſheweth the order that is to be obſerued, the feare of God challengeth the firſt place, and goeth before the honour of the King. Let vs therefore ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

And concerning the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, whatſoeuer they pretend, they cannot be the Princes Friends, becauſe (as we haue ſhewed) they care not to keep their Lawes, and if they had a care of Princes Lawes, they would alſo haue a regard of Gods Lawes.</p>

The firſt obiection is concerning the keeping and retaining of <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> the obiection is wanting, and may be thus ſupplyed. For <hi>Philemon</hi> might haue ſaide; I heare many words, how profitable he is to me, how deare to thee. I know no ſuch profit in him, I can ſee no benefit that I am like to receiue by him: of this I am well aſſured, I haue ſuſtained great loſſe by him. If then he be ſo neceſſary and profitable, and if he be as deare vnto thee, as the Sonne that commeth out of the Bowels of the father, why didſt thou not retaine him ſtill with thee? To this the Apoſtle maketh a double anſwere; firſt he graunteth, and then he reuoketh that which he had graunted. For hee confeſſeth, that his deſire was to haue detained him: which he maketh plaine by a reaſon drawne from the end, that he might haue continued [<hi>To miniſter vnto him in the bonds of the Gospell.</hi>] In the next verſe he ioyneth a correcting of that which he had granted; to wit, that he would doe nothing in this matter without the aſſent and conſent of <hi>Philemon</hi> his Maiſter: which reuocation he amplyfieth by an Argument from the end, <hi>That thy benefit ſhould not bee as it were of neceſſitie,</hi> which alſo is declared by the contrary, [<hi>but willingly.</hi>] In theſe wordes, howſoeuer they bee naturally the preuenting of an obiection, is included alſo a certaine reaſon. For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in this Epiſtle vſeth more ſhew of Art, and force of perſwading, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of reaſoning, and skill of creeping into the heart of <hi>Philemon,</hi> then he vſeth ordinarily in other places: and therefore in remoouing obiections hee argueth, and in arguing he remooueth Obiections. This appeareth eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in this place. For he reaſoneth and ſtrengthneth his requeſt by this Argument:

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The meaning of the words.</note> This is to be conſidered of vs, touching the order of the wordes: Now let vs ſee what is to be knowne concerning the meaning of them. When he ſaith [<hi>Whom I would haue retained</hi>] he ſheweth againe what great account he
<pb facs="tcp:7222:149" rendition="simple:additions"/> maketh of <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> being as it were the onely man whom he would haue made choiſe off (if it had beene in his liberty) to haue comforted him, and miniſtred vnto him in the time of his affliction and impriſonment. Againe, when he ſaith; [<hi>For thee</hi>] or in thy ſtead, he inferreth, that <hi>Philemon</hi> himſelfe did owe vnto him that duty, if he ſhould require it of him, and vrge it from him. He mentioneth, <hi>The bondes of the Gospell,</hi> meaning thereby, the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which the Goſpell had brought him, wherein the Genetiue caſe doth note the cauſe as we ſaw before, verſe 1. and 9. As if he ſhould ſay, the cauſe why I am priſoner and put in bands, is the preaching of the Goſpell. In the 14. verſe he ſaith; <hi>Without thy mind I would doe nothing,</hi> where, by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall put for the ſpecial, he meaneth without thy counſell and conſent I would not doe this thing; that is, retaine <hi>Oneſimus</hi> with me, I would doe nothing touching the keeping of him from thee, to whom as thy Seruant he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, he addeth, <hi>Leaſt it ſhould be of neceſſity;</hi> that is, leaſt I ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort and wring it from thee againſt thy will, and ſo ſeeme to compell thee hereunto, whereas thou ſhouldſt doe it cheerefully and willingly. This is the Method and meaning of this diuiſion, according to which order and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, the words are thus much in effect. If thou aske a reaſon why I kept not <hi>Oneſimus</hi> with me, ſeeing I make him ſo profitable, and worthy to be loued and liked, ſo comfortable, truſty, and ſeruiceable: I aunſwere, I could haue beene content with all my heart to haue done ſo, he is my Son, and I his Father: but withall, he is thy Seruant, and not mine; and thou art his Maiſter, and not I; and therefore I ought not, without thy leaue, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and conſent to keepe him, for the Goſpell maintaineth, and not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolueth politicke order and houſhold gouernment, which both are the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God. Beſides, a benefit and good turne ſhould come, with a cheerefull heart and a willing mind, and ought not to be gotten by conſtraint and compulſion, and therefore I would know thy will, before I kept him to my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Diuers pointes to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> Before we come to the particular handling of the Doctrines that ariſe from hence, ſome thinges breefely are to be noted, which I will breefely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, without any long and large application. Firſt of all, the Apoſtle inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth his deſire, to haue retained <hi>Oneſimus</hi> with him, and that he was loath to ſuffer him to depart from him: which declareth that the preſence of thoſe that are deare vnto vs in Chriſt, is welcome, pleaſant, comfortable, &amp; much ſet by, and we greatly deſire to keepe them continually with vs. For as loue is the knot of coniunction that bindeth vs together, though we be abſent and farre ſeuered one from another: ſo it craueth and requireth the bodilie preſence of thoſe whom we entirely loue, which howſoeuer wee cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in this life, for as much as our earthly affaires will not ſuffer it, yet wee ſhall be ſure to enioy it perpetually, and without ende in the life to come, when we ſhall haue the greateſt ioy and comfort one in another that can be wiſhed or deſired; ſuch as the eye hath not ſeene, nor the eare heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man to conceiue.</p>
               <p>Secondly, note with me the end why he deſired to retaine <hi>Oneſimus</hi> with him, that the Seruant might doe ſeruice to him in the Maiſters ſtead. The end then, is, the Miniſtery and attendance which <hi>Paule</hi> might of duty require of <hi>Philemon</hi> himſelfe. If then the Maiſter be bound to doe his ſeruice, and wait vpon the Apoſtle, much more the Seruant! Whereby we may note and marke, how great right and iuriſdiction hee that hath gotten and gained a man to Chriſt, hath, ouer him whom hee hath gained, ſo that he may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge not onely one of his Seruants, but himſelfe to Miniſter vnto him, and to help him in temporall and tranſitory things. For he that hath receiued ſpirituall bleſſings, cannot without great vnthankfulneſſe deny corporall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:7222:150"/> ſo that it cannot be expreſſed how well he hath deſerued of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whom he hath won by the word to God, <note n="c" place="margin">Col. 1, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>And deliuered him by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry from the power of darkeneſſe, and tranſlated into the Kingdome of his deare Sonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, we may obſerue, in the Apoſtles correcting of his former grant, that as he is commended that doth his duty that is required of him, freely and willingly, ſo he is worthy to be praiſed and commended, that doth not goe about to wring and wreſt a benefit againſt a mans will, though it be due debt and a bounden duty, but laboureth by all meanes, that it may be volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and not vpon neceſſity: for hereby it commeth to paſſe oftentimes, that he not onely getteth a benefit, but winneth his heart and good will that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it: and many times it falleth out, that the minde of the giuer is more to be reſpected then the guift it ſelfe, as we ſee in the poore Widdow mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Goſpell; <note n="d" place="margin">Luk. 21, 2, 3.</note> who caſting into the treaſury two mites, is ſaid to haue giuen of her penury, more then all the rich men that beſtomed of their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity. Thus much of the generall obſeruations. Now let vs come to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Doctrines.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">[<hi>I would haue retained him with me, that for thee he might haue miniſtred vnto me in the bonds of the Gospell.</hi>]</q> The Apoſtle in theſe wordes, doth claime both <hi>Philemon</hi> and <hi>Oneſimus</hi> to owe vnto him, being in bondes, their ſeruice and comfortable adminiſtration. Indeede he ſenderh his Seruant backe to him: yet he ſeemeth cloſely and ſecretly to inſinuate, that hee would take it thankfully at his handes, and receiue it as a guift moſt welcome vnto him, if <hi>Philemon</hi> would returne him to him againe: and that he ſhould deſerue more praiſe, if of his owne accord and liberality he would haue ſent back his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant now reſtored vnto him, of whoſe helpe and Miniſtery he had ſo great neede. The Seruants of Chriſt that ſuffer for his Name, are to be ſuccoured by what duties ſoeuer we can. For ſeeing the baniſhing of our perſons, the whippings of our bodies, the ſpoiling of our goods, the impairing of our good Name, and many other reproaches and afflictions doe accompany the preaching and profeſſion of the Goſpell, whoſoeuer ſhrinketh back from ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them, and refuſeth to be partaker of them when God calleth him to beare witneſſe vnto the truth, he renounceth the Goſpell, forſaketh his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and ſeparateth himſelfe from Chriſt. The defence of the Goſpell is common to all, and euery man muſt be an helper to the truth. Therefore the man that ſuffereth perſecution for Gods cauſe and the Goſpels, is not to be accounted as a priuate perſon, but as one that diſchargeth a publike duty of the whole Church, and therefore the care of him, generally lieth vpon the ſhoulders of all thoſe that profeſſe the faith. <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Euery Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is bound to ſerue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good of the Church, by what meanes ſoeuer God hath inabled him.</note> From hence we learne, that help, ſuccour, and ſeruice, is a due debt from all that truely are religious, to them that ſuffer for the Goſpell and for righteouſnes ſake. We ſee how <hi>Paul</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it of <hi>Philemon</hi> and <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> that they ſhould in his bondes Miniſter vnto him, and helpe him in his diſtreſſe. The vertue heere required, is that fruit of loue, by which a man becommeth a Seruant to euery one for their good, within the compaſſe of his calling. So then, euery Chriſtian is bound to ſerue the common good of the Church, and of them that haue need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by his guiftes, by his goods, by his wiſedome, by his authority, and by what other meanes ſoeuer God hath inabled him.

Firſt, whatſoeuer gifts are beſtowed vppon vs, to this end they are beſtowed, to profit with all, to helpe one another, and to edifie that body whereof we are members. We are all Fellow-members of one body, and therefore are bound to releeue and refreſh our Brethren. Euery member ſerueth one another, &amp; are for the whole. Nature it ſelfe in other things, teacheth vs this duty. The Sunne as the eye of the World, ſhineth not for it ſelfe, it yeildeth not heat for it ſelfe, but for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

                  <hi>Whoſoeuer will be great among you, ſhall be your Seruant: and whoſoeuer will bee cheefe of you, ſhall be the Seruant of all, for euen the Son of man came, not to bee ſerued, but to ſerue; and to giue his life for the ranſome of many.</hi> Where hee ſheweth, that the way to true honour is to ſerue, ſo that the greater ſeruice we doe to the Brethren, the greater honour we ſhall receiue at the handes of God. The greater our ſeruice is, the greater ſhall be our reward, when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one ſhall receiue according vnto his work. This we ſee farther ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto vs in the example of Chriſt, who humbled himſelfe to waſh his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples feete, and to wipe them with a Towell being waſhed, and ſaide vnto them; <note n="r" place="margin">Iohn 13, 4, 12, 13, 14, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Know ye what I haue done vnto you? Ye call me Maiſter and Lord, and ye ſay well, for ſo am I: if I then your Lord and Maiſter haue waſhed your feet, ye ought alſo to waſh one anothers feete: for I haue giuen you an example, that ye ſhould do, euen as I haue done to you, the Seruant is not greater then his Maiſter, nor the Ambaſſadour greater then he that ſent him.</hi> We are taught to ſet Chriſt the moſt abſolute example before our eyes, to learne humbleneſſe of minde, and the duty of ſeruice one to another: we muſt conſider him in his glory, and in his humilitie. Firſt, in his glory as our King, as our head, as our Lord, and as our Maiſter: then in his humility, as abaſed and humbled in our Fleſh vnto death, euen to the death of the Croſſe. When we haue done this, then we are thus to reaſon with our ſelues; hath Chriſt in his great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry caſt downe himſelfe for my ſake: and ought not I, if I were the higheſt vpon earth, ſtoope downe to my equals? Ought not I, that am his Subiect, his body, his Diſciple, his Seruant, to ſerue the neceſſities of my Fellow-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants?

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 3.</note> Thirdly, true Religion conſiſteth in miniſtring to the Saints, in helping and ſuccouring of the poore, in imploying himſelfe to the good of others, as a Candle that ſpendeth &amp; waſteth it ſelfe to giue light to them that are in the houſe.

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</note> Let vs now proceede to handle the Vſes, and edifie our ſelues thereby in our moſt holy Faith, and in all Chriſtian obedience. Firſt, this ſerueth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue thoſe that haue forgotten all true ſeruice to the faithfull. Many there are that haue no feeling of the troubles and turmoyles that fall vppon the deare Seruants of God. Their eyes are cloſed, and their hearts are hardned, they haue no bowels of compaſſion to Miniſter vnto them, they haue no handes open to releeue them. The rich of our Churches, who haue this Worlds good giuen vnto them, are either in their vnſatiable deſires (as Hell or the Graue) poore, wrongfully getting, miſerably keeping, vnconſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſcraping, and vniuſtly pulling from others, without meane or meaſure; or elſe they ſpend their wealth and conſume their ſubſtance; ſome in Haukes and Hounds; others, in ſumptuous apparrell; others, in exceſſiue Feaſtings; others, in worſe vſes, which I will not name, all being vnneceſſary and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe things, vnprofitable for the Church or Common-wealth, ſo that little can bee ſpared for the poore Saints, and that which is ſpared, is as hardly drawne from them, as a peece of fleſh out of their ſides. Theſe men neuer thinke of doing ſeruice to others, but of ſeruing their owne turnes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities: which ought not ſo to be among them that profeſſe Chriſt Ieſus, who ſerued not himſelfe, nor ſought his owne benefit, nor minded his owne gaine and glory, nor lifted vp himſelfe aboue others, nor deſired to get earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riches, nor went about to empoueriſh others: but being <note n="x" place="margin">2 Cor. 8, 9.</note> rich, he became poore; being Heire of all things, <note n="y" place="margin">Math. 8, 20.</note> he had not whereon to lay his head; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lord of all, he became Seruant vnto all. Hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, <note n="z" place="margin">Hebr. 4, 15. and 2, 17, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>We haue not an High-prieſt which cannot be touched with the feeling of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, but was in all things tempted in like ſort, yet without ſinne.</hi> And a little before in the ſame Epiſtle; <hi>In all things it behooued him to be made like vnto his Brethren, that he might be mercifull and a faithfull High-priest in things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God, that he might make reconciliation for the ſins of the people: for in that he ſuffered he was tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeareth, that Chriſt Ieſus hath a liuely feeling of our infirmities, and an inward touch of our wants, he is not ſlightly affected with our infirmities, but as the head is when the members are pained. And if we be the true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his body, wee will remember, and cannot forget them that are in bonds; <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 13, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>But be greeued as if we were bound with them: and them that are in affliction, as though we were alſo afflicted in the body.</hi> This compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoſe that are in miſery, is an aſſured pledge, and a comfortable Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony vnto vs, that we are engrafted into Chriſt, and vnited to all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that we haue a Communion with him as with our head, and that wee haue a communion with the faithfull, as with his members. But if we bee without feeling of the afflictions of <hi>Ioſeph;</hi> that is, of the troubles of the Church, we are without Chriſt, without Faith, without Loue, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; and conſequently, without peace and conſolation in our heartes. For what peace can hee haue that is out of Chriſt, who is the Authour of peace? Without whom, all thinges are but trouble and vexation of Spirit. Or what conſolation can we haue that we are his members, when wee haue no ſenſe or ſight of the troubles and infirmities that are incident to our Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-members?</p>
               <p>Secondly, it reprooueth ſuch, as in the pride and haughtineſſe of their harts do ſcorne to do ſeruice to the poore Saints, and think it a great diſgrace
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:7222:152" rendition="simple:additions"/> to them, to caſt their eyes vpon ſuch contemptible creatures. But wouldeſt thou haue Chriſt looke vpon thee, and haue a reſpect vnto thee? Then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine not thou to looke vpon his members, which are vnto thee in place of Chriſt, ſo often as they ſuffer in his cauſe. In what a miſerable caſe ſhall they be in at the laſt day, to whom Chriſt Ieſus the Lord of life, ſhall ſay; <hi>Depart from me, I know ye not?</hi> Now, if we in this life, turne away our faces from the faithful, and are aſhamed of them in the day of their calamity, &amp; ſay to them, <hi>Depart from me, I know you not.</hi> Let vs take heede that he be not aſhamed of vs before his Father, and before the elect Angels. The higheſt that are vpon the earth, muſt not refuſe to ſhew all fruirs of loue euen toward the meaneſt for Chriſts ſake, but bee ready to acknowledge that they haue receiued their Callings and Dignities, not to lift vp their hearts aboue their bretheren, but be as Fathers, as Shepheards, as Nurſſes, to nouriſh and cheriſh ſuch as want their helpe. This is it which good <hi>Mordecai</hi> did teach <hi>Eſter,</hi> when the church was as it were in trauell, and in great danger, <note n="b" place="margin">Eſt. 4, 13, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Thinke not with thy ſelfe, that thou ſhalt eſcape more then all the Iewes, for if thou holdeſt thy peace at this time, comfort and deliuerance ſhall appeare to the Iewes out of another place, but thou and thy Fathers houſe ſhall perriſh, and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdome for ſuch a time?</hi> Where hee putteth her in minde, that the cauſe of her aduancement was to be a Nurſing Mother vnto the Church, and that it was the end which God aymed at, in calling of her to that place of dignitie. And as the greateſt are not to ſcorne the ſmalleſt, nor the higheſt bee aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the loweſt, nor the richeſt trample vnder their feete, the pooreſt; ſo on the other ſide, the meaneſt and loweſt, muſt not enuie others that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue them, but know that they likewiſe are bounde to doe ſeruice to them, according to the vtmoſt of their power and endeuour. Who was meaner in place and condition then <hi>Oneſimus?</hi> yet the Apoſtle teſtifyeth of him in this place, that <hi>Hee had miniſtred vnto him in the bondes of the Gospell.</hi> So there is no man ſo poore, ſo lowe, ſo ſmall in his owne eyes, and in the eyes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but he may doe ſome good to others, and thereby gaine glorie vnto God, and to his Goſpell.</p>
               <p>If then, wee thinke that the pouertie of our condition, or the meanneſſe of our place, or the baſeneſſe of our perſon, ſhall excuſe vs, or exempt vs from ſeruing Chriſt and his Church, and that it skilleth not, though wee liue as ydle Drones, and vnprofitable burthens to the earth that beareth vs; wee deceiue our ſelues, and bereaue our ſelues of much comfort, that wee might receiue, by bearing our ſelues painefully and profitably in our Callings. The Apoſtle inſtructing all perſonnes in the Church, to behaue themſelues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contempt and enuy, prooueth it notably by a compariſon drawne from the members of the bodie, <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 12, 20 21, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>There are manie Members, yet but one bodie: and the eye cannot ſay vnto the hand, I haue no neede of thee: nor the heade againe to the feete, I haue no neede of you; yea, much rather thoſe Members of the bodie, which ſeeme to bee more feeble, are neceſſarie.</hi> The Rich, cannot want the poore, and therefore may not contemne them; and the poore cannot want the rich, and therefore may not backbite them, and enuy at them. For as God hath tempered the body together, that one member ſhould ſtand in need of the helpe of another; ſo is it in the things of this life, one liueth by another, and therefore, one muſt haue a care of another, and ſeeke the good one of another.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, heere are reprooued all mercileſſe men, that ſhut vppe their pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and compaſsion from the poore, and therefore haue not the Loue of GOD dwelling in them, nor the Loue of Children remaining in them. For whoſoeuer loueth GOD, will for his ſake Loue his Brother alſo. The Apoſtle Iohn, <note n="d" place="margin">1 Iohn 4, 7, 8, 20, 21.</note> handleth this Argument at large, in his firſt Epiſtle, and the fourth Chapter, where he ſaith, <hi>Beloued, let vs loue one another, for loue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:7222:152"/> of God, and euerie one that loueth is borne of God, and knoweth God: he that loueth not, knoweth not God, for God is loue. If any man ſay, I loue God, and hate his Brother, he is a lyar; for how can he that loueth not his Brother whom he hath ſeene, loue God whom he hath not ſeene? And this commaundement haue wee of him, that he which loueth God, ſhould loue his Brother alſo.</hi> To this purpoſe the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <note n="e" place="margin">Iames 2, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>There ſhall be condemnation mercileſſe, to him that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not mercy, and mercy reioyceth againſt iudgement.</hi> If then, we look for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, let vs ſhew mercy. There is no poore Begger that craueth an Almes at thy doore, there is no man ſtandeth in ſo great neede of thy helpe, that liueth with thee, as thou wanteſt the mercy and fauour of God to comfort thee, to cloath thee, to feede thee, to ſuccour thee, to heare thee, to help thee, when thou crieſt vnto him. We are all as naked and needy Beggers that knocke at his gate, and we are wholly nouriſhed by his hand. We are al as poore ſuters, ſuing for his grace and fauour, and we cannot liue if we be denied, and take the repulſe of him. Wee receiue mercy, vnder condition to ſhew mercie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. If we be vnmerciful, we make our ſelues vnworthy to receiue any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from God.</p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 2</note> Secondly, ſeeing we are ſeruants to all, to helpe them by all the means we can, by comfort or counſell; by word or deed; by our wealth or authoritie; or whatſoeuer God ſhall inable vs: from hence ariſeth a great comfort vnto a mans conſcience, and an aſſurance of his peace and acceptation with God, to pray vnto him with comfort for his graces, not doubting to obtain them, if we haue bin ſeruiceable and comfortable vnto others, eſpecially to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God, that are as deare to him as the Apple of his eye. It is a meanes of excellent ioy and peace to a man, to conſider that hee hath employed all the good things he hath to the vſe of Gods houſe, and his houſhold ſeruants: for when any common daunger ſhall fall, or hee finde anguiſh and affliction of Conſcience for ſinne, he may be aſſured of comfort, ſeeing GOD hath wrought this ſincerity, and ſet it as a ſeale of his mercie in his heart. <hi>Obadiah</hi> hauing beene in the practiſe of this dutie a diligent ſeruant, and perfourmed moſt notable ſeruice when <hi>Iezabell</hi> ſought the deſtruction of the Prophets, he hid an hundered of them, by fiftie and fiftie in a Caue, and gaue them Bread to eate, ſhewing himſelfe liberall handed, and tender-hearted, with the hazard of his owne credite, fauour, and life. When hee met <hi>Eliah,</hi> that willed him <note n="f" place="margin">1 Kings 18, 12, 13.</note> to go to his Lord, and tolde him, he would ſhew himſelfe vnto him, although <hi>Obadiah</hi> at the firſt feared and diſtruſted, and thought the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God would carrie him away to ſome other place, and then <hi>Ahab</hi> would kill him, he beganne at the length to comfort himſelfe with the meditation of his ſeruice that hee had done to the Saintes: <hi>Doeſt thou not know that I feare God? and haſt thou not heard of the fruits of it that I tooke in the heate of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and in the bitterneſſe of this long iudgement, and in the extreamity of this famine, an hundred of the Lords Prophets, &amp; how I hid them, and fed them ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in two Caues of the earth? If thou account of this my ſeruice, and haſt iudged me faithfull to the Lord, let this moue thee, not to giue mee ouer into the hands of thine and mine enemy.</hi>

                  <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> an excellent Prince, he did ſo employ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his ſeruice to the good of the Church, that hee regarded not his owne profite, but ſpent of his owne Goodes and ſubſtaunce, becauſe the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of the people was exceeding great, ſo that hee entertained them at his owne coſt and charges: From whence, hee gathereth vnto himſelfe this comfort (as <hi>Obadiah</hi> had done before, who prooueth, that hee feared the Lorde, and aſſured his Conſcience thereof, becauſe hee had preſerued and nouriſhed the true Prophets of God. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> (I ſay) gathereth this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, by ſuccouring the poore ſeruants of God in diſtreſſe, that God, not for the deſert of the woorke, but the grace of his owne mercie (who crowneth

Nay, it were well with many, if they had onely done no good, if they had onely beene barren and brought forth no good fruit, and if they had onely done no hurt to the Church. For their daily practiſes cry out againſt them, and the teares of the faithfull which they haue ſhed; what ſaid I, their teares? Nay their blood which they haue poured out as Water, doth witneſſe euidently againſt them, that they haue brought forth plentiful fruits, of hatted, of enmity, of mallice, of outragiouſneſſe againſt the Church. Their owne conſciences accuſe them, and Gods people haue felt them, and in the end fearefull iudgements ſhall ouertake them. No enemy of the Church that ſet himſelfe againſt <hi>Sion,</hi> hath euer proſpered. O that that they had hearts to conſider theſe things, but now are they hidden from them. God hath giuen them breath and life to doe good to his Church, and hee hath lifted vp their heads aboue others in wealth and authority to ſerue him: but they are going out of the World, before they know wherefore they came into the World. And when they muſt leaue the World and depart out of it, wherein they haue beene but Tennants at will, they remember with anguiſh and terrour of conſcience, that they haue done nothing leſſe then that for which they were ſent into it, but haue imployed their goods, their ſtrength, their wit, their wiſedome, their life, their dignity, and all to oppreſſe and vex the Church; yea, to root it (if it were poſſible) out of the earth. It were good they could in time remember their fore-Fathers, <hi>Pharaoh, Senacharib, Ahab, Iezabell, Iudas, Herod,</hi> and ſuch like Perſecutours and Enemies, that breathed out threatnings againſt the Church: and as they reſemble them in their life, let them take heede they follow them not in their death, and after their death. But let vs that practiſe better things know, that God doubtleſſe will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them in kindneſſe, that remember the afflicted Saints, and caſt ſuch off with ſhame and diſhonour, that doe deſpiſe and deſpight them. We haue a worthy example heereof in <hi>Ebed-melech,</hi> recorded by the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Ier. 38, 8, 9. &amp; 39, 16, 17, 18.</note> who becauſe he intreated for the Prophet, and ſuffered him not to lie in the Dungeon, and to dye for hunger, through the falſe ſuggeſtions of his mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious enemies, God ſhewed mercy vnto him, and deliuered him from the plague that fell vpon the Citty.</p>

If the Miniſter haue laboured in the duties of his calling, and in the ſeruice of the Church, and in the execution of his Miniſtry, and in the feeding of the flock committed vnto him, he hath wherein to comfort himſelfe, he may be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his loue vnto Chriſt, and conſequently of Chriſtes loue toward him. Wee muſt remember what Chriſt ſaide to <hi>Peter; Louest</hi> 
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Iohn. 21, 16, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>thou me?

                  <hi>The loue of Christ conſtraineth vs.</hi> If then we conſider what loue the Lord hath ſhewed toward vs, or behold how deare his Church is vnto him, and with how great a price hee hath redeemed it, wee cannot but in the Meditation thereof be thruſt forward (if we loue him, or regard him) to performe the duties of our Miniſtration, although they be mightie painefull, in ſeeding, in weeding, in plauting, in ſtrengthning, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting, according as daily occaſion ſhall be offered vnto vs. But if wee

We ſhall receiue more ſound com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and peace, when we ſhal depart this world, and remember what account we are to giue of our paines taken in our calling, in our labours vndertaken in the Miniſtery, then in the heaping vp of many liuinges, and the getting of much riches. If we haue gained but one ſoule to God, he ſhall ſtand vp for vs, when all the mucke of this earth ſhall fall downe. He ſhall be our ioy and our crowne, when all other delights ſhall giue vs the farewell. Neyther doth this Doctrine and duty ſerue onely for the comfort of the Miniſter, <note n="p" place="margin" type="runSum">How the people are to comfort them ſelus in ſeruing the Church.</note> but for the comfort of the people that haue endeuoured in their callings to ſerue the Church, and laboured vnfaignedly to ſeeke the wel-fare thereof. They that haue had a ſweete feeling of the loue of God, are carefull to loue him againe: and they that loue him in ſingleneſſe of heart, will be enforced and conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to loue his children, and to doe all the ſeruice they can vnto them. They will thinke no dutie too much, they will thinke all they haue done, all they can do to the Church, to bee too little. Hence it is, that Chriſt Ieſus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the Church of <hi>Tyatira,</hi> for ſuch good works as were found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <note n="q" place="margin">Reuel. 2, 19</note> beginneth with <hi>Loue and Seruice;</hi> Firſt, he mentioneth their Loue, then he addeth their Seruice, to ſhew that as our Loue muſt appeare by our fruits of Seruice, ſo all our Seruice muſt proceede from Loue to thoſe whome wee ſerue. If a man imploy himſelfe neuer ſo dilligently, and take neuer ſo great paines, and trauaile with all his power, for the peace and good of the church, yet if it proceed not from a ſincere loue toward them, but either from a loue of gaine, or a deſire of glory, or a fame of praiſe, he ſhall receiue no rewarde at the hands of God. This ſeruice, as at all times we muſt bee ready to make it appeare, ſo eſpecially wee muſt ſhewe it in the neceſſities of the Church. When it lyeth vnder the heat of perſecution, or feeleth the Arrow of famine, or beareth the affliction of pouerty, and groaneth vnder the waight of theſe burdens, we muſt remember that we owe our ſeruice to them as a dutie, and that we are the ſeruants of the Church. This ſhall bee our crowne and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the laſt day.</p>

Thus they that doo good to the Church, do good to themſelues: they that giue much vnto them, do receiue more; and ſuch as haue beene helpfull and ſeruiceable to Gods people, ſhall finde them as their remembrancers to God, who will not forget the labour of their loue, and the duty of their ſeruice.

On the other ſide, ſuch as haue beene, not helpfull, but hurtful; not induſtrious, but iniurious; not ſeruiceable, but vnprofitable to Gods people; when God ſhall viſit them either with publicke calamities, or priuate iudgements, their owne Conſciences ſhall gall them, and gnaw vpon them, when they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their owne works, which ſhall prouoke men to ſpeak euill of them, cauſe them to pray againſt them, and conſtraine them to call vppon God to worke their confuſion. This we ſee in <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle, in the latter end of the ſame Epiſtle, <note n="t" place="margin">2 Tim. 4, 14</note> 
                  <hi>Alexander the Copper-ſmith hath done me much euill, the Lord reward him according to his workes.</hi> Thus doeth the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> deale oftentimes in the Pſalmes, <note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 74, 2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Thinke vpon thy congregation which thou haſt poſſeſſed of old, &amp; on the rod of thine inheritance, which thou haſt redeemed, and on this mount Syon, wherein thou haſt dwelt: lift vp thy ſtroakes, that thou mayſt for euer deſtroy eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie enemy that doth euil to the Sanctuary.</hi> Thus wee ſee the people of God haue from time to time prayed againſt the malicious enemies of the Church, that ſought the ruine and deſtruction thereof. Their prayers are of great force, &amp; enter into the eares of the Lord of hoſtes, whether it bee to obtaine mercies vpon the friends of the Church, or to draw downe vengeance vppon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries thereof, that oppreſſe it with cruelty, and blaſpheme the name of God, which is holy throughout all ages and generations. There is no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter honour that we ſhould deſire or delight in, then to be called the friends of God, and the ſeruants of the Church. If we be the ſeruants of God, wee muſt alſo account our ſelues the ſeruants of the Church. The Prophet Dauid did eſteeme the faithfull that were in Ieruſalem, as his Brethren. So on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſide, there cannot a greater diſhonor and reproach befall vs, then to be reputed the enemies of God and his people. For if wee ſet our ſelues againſt his people, that are his portion and inheritance, hee will no otherwiſe deale with vs, then with his enemies. If God come againſt vs as his enemy, we ſhall not be able to preuaile, we cannot ſtand before him, but ſhall be as ſtubble in the fire, and as chaffe before the winde.</p>

This is the common courſe and current of the world, wee will not ſee the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the poore Saints, but turne away our eyes from them; or if wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chooſe but ſee them, we quickly forget them, as if wee had neuer eyther beheld them, or knowne of them. This is one miſery of the faithful, that men do not regard them when they are in miſery. The Lord hath determined, that there ſhall be alwayes ſome obiects offered vnto vs, and ſet before vs to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the fruits of our Faith and Loue. He hath ſaide, that the poore wee ſhall alwayes haue with vs, and ſuch as ſtand in need of our helpe and comfort. It is in eaſie thing to boaſt of Faith and Loue: but if we will be aſſured, that we haue true Faith indeed, we muſt ſhew it by our workes, which are the fruites whereby it is knowne. We muſt not turne away our faces from the faithfull, as the Prieſt and Leuite did in the Goſpell, but be ready to helpe, as God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ability, and offereth opportunity. Nay, it is not enough for vs to ſuccor ſuch religious Saints, as we ſee want ſuccour, but we muſt learne and labour to know the ſtate of the Church, and aske of others howe it fareth with the godly poore among vs. The children of God haue gone before vs in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this dutie. It is noted of <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the faithfull, that he waited not till the ſtrangers craued entertainment at his hands, but he ran to meete them from the Tent doore, and prayed them to take ſome refreſhing at his hands, <note n="z" place="margin">Ge. 18, &amp; 19 Heb. 13, 2.</note> whereby he receiued Angels into his houſe at vnawares.

               <p>The like we might ſay of <hi>Lot,</hi> who ſat at the gate of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and roſe vp to meete the men, and prayed them to turne into their ſeruants houſe, and to lodge with him all night.

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 1.</note> Let vs ſee hovv the reaſons vvil make this better to appeare vnto vs, that vve may haue ſtrong proofe to put the matter out of all doubt.

                  <note n="l" place="margin">2 Cor. 9, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>As euery man wiſheth in his heart, ſo let him giue, not grudgingly, or of neceſſitie, for God loueth a chearefull giuer.</hi> Now, that which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of charity and of almes, may as truely be ſpoken of euery dutie that God requireth of vs. When wee pray we muſt call vpon God chearefully, for he loueth a cheerefull prayer. When we giue thankes to his name for bleſsings receiued, wee muſt thanke him chearefully, for he loueth a chearful giuer of thankes; and albeit theſe be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table parts of Gods worſhip and excellent duties commaunded of him, and required of vs; yet without this chearfulneſſe, they are as a dead thing, &amp; not regarded.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 2.</note> Secondly, our obedience vnto God, muſt bee anſwereable to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt, that hee performed to his Father; for hee hath therein giuen vs an example, and taught vs how to obey. The maner of his obedience was willing, and done of his own accord, not extorted and wreſted from him, for then it could not haue beene accepted of God, nor merritorious for vs, nor praiſed in him. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle ſaith, <note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 10, 9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Then ſaide he, Loe I come to do thy will, ô God, he taketh away the firſt, that hee may eſtabliſh the ſecond. By the which will we are ſanctified, euen by the offering of the body of Ieſus Chriſt once made.</hi> Thus Chriſt himſelfe ſpeaketh in the Goſpell, <note n="n" place="margin">Iohn. 10, 17, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Therefore dooth my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loue me, becauſe I lay downe my life, that I might take it again: No man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it from me, but I lay it downe of my ſelfe, I haue power to lay it down, &amp; haue power to take it againe.</hi> Where he ſheweth, that the cauſe wherefore he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, was not becauſe <hi>Caiphas</hi> conuented him, or the witneſſes accuſed him, or <hi>Pilate</hi> condemned him, or the Iewes executed him, but becauſe it pleaſed his Father and himſelfe to make himſelfe an offering for ſinne. For except hee had died willingly, all his aduerſaries had bin too weake to work any thing againſt him, <note n="o" place="margin">Iohn 18, 6.</note> as appeareth in euidently the Garden, when hee caſt them all downe to the ground with a word of his mouth. Heere is ſet down a pattern for vs to follow: we muſt performe the like obedience that he did, as his was voluntarily and willing, ſo ought ours likewiſe to be, that it may be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 3</note> Thirdly, the things that are not done in Faith and Loue, are ſinne. For, without faith it is vnpoſsible <note n="p" place="margin">Heb: 11, 6</note> to pleaſe God. And though I had the guifts of propheſy, and knew al ſecrets, and al knowledge, yea if I had al faith, ſo that if I could remoue mountaines, <note n="q" place="margin">1 Cor. 13, 2, 3</note> and had not loue, I were nothing; &amp; though I feede the poore with all my goods, and though I giue my body that I bee burned, and haue not loue, it profiteth nothing. So then we ſee, that no du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is acceptable without Faith and Loue. But nothing done vnwillingly, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortably, or hypocritically can be done in Faith and Loue. And therefore ſuch duties as are thus perfourmed, haue no life nor vertue in them, to giue them any grace or acceptation with God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 4</note> Laſtly, God knoweth our hearts, and ſeeth hovv vve bring our guifts, &amp; offer our offerings. He looketh not vpon the outward vvorke, but regardeth the intent of the heart. When <hi>Caine</hi> brought vnto God an oblation of the fruites of the ground, <note n="r" place="margin">Gen: 4, 5.</note> he had no regard to him nor to his offring, becauſe he ſavv the hollowneſſe and hypocriſie of his heart.

               </p>
               <p>Where we ſee, the Father carefull for the future good of his ſon, mooueth
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:7222:156"/> him to endeuour and ſtriue to know God by learning what he willeth, &amp; to ſerue him vprightly and willingly, by practiſing as hee enableth, becauſe our thoughts are not hidden from the all-ſeeing eye of God, and becauſe he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth himſelfe to them that ſeeke him, but forſaketh them that refuſe him, when he is offered. We may eaſily deceiue the eye of man, that looketh only to the perſon, and beholdeth only the outward worke; but it is vnpoſſible to deceiue the ſearcher of hearts. If then we gather al theſe reaſons into a ſhort ſum, and ſet them as in a Table before our eyes, if we conſider that God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a chearfull ſeruice, that Chriſt performed a willing obedience, that faith and loue giueth acceptance to the work; and laſtly, that God giueth recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence according to the heart, which he knoweth; we ſee that the ſtrength of them will beare the ful waight of this concluſion, that the duties of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion muſt not be performed conſtrainedly, but freely; not grudgingly, but chearefully; not vnwillingly, but readily; not of neceſſity, but voluntarily.</p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</note> Now we are to make Vſe of this Doctrine. Firſt, ſeeing no man muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme any holy duty to God or man vpon compulſion, or againſt his will, but with all his minde and might, we learne that euery action or dutie is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of by God, not according to the greatneſſe of the worker, or outwarde ſhew of the worke, but according to the will and affection of the dooer: it is the manner of dooing that God more accepteth, then the action or deede it ſelfe. A Childe in his obedience to his Father, is eſteemed for his reuerent, louing, obedient, and dutifull heart, and not for the greatneſſe or worthines of his worke. For what can he do, when hee hath endeuoured to the vtmoſt, to pleaſure his Father? So is it with vs, when we haue done all that wee can, we muſt confeſſe we haue bin vnptofitable ſeruants, and therefore God more reſpecteth the intention, then the action; the Worke-man, then the worke; the affection, then the effect. <hi>Mary</hi> is commended of Chriſt, <note n="t" place="margin">Luke 7, 47, and 21, 3, 4.</note>

Or can they deſerue to be accepted? No, in no wiſe: but God accepteth the manner, more then the matter; how they are done, more then what is done. This is it which the Apoſtle expreſſeth, 2 Cor. 8, 12. <hi>If there bee firſt a willing minde, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that a man hath not.</hi> This layeth before vs the abundant kindneſſe of God, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he be a ſpirit euery way perfect, yet he accepteth our lame and defectiue ſeruice. Our duties ſhall be all acceptable in his ſight, though they bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in great weakeneſſe, and mingled with many imperfections (which were ſufficient to cauſe them to be reiected and refuſed) if we be carefull to do them in the truth and vprightneſſe of our hearts, and with chearefull and ready minds. All things muſt be done in loue, and this muſt bee conſidered in all the workes of our hands. This miniſtreth a double comfort; Firſt, vnto ſuch as are of poore and lowe degree, to conſider that GOD regardeth the heart more then the hand, and our willingneſſe more then our worke. Hence it is, that euen ſeruants whoſe condition is loweſt in the family, and which meddle not in great matters, or in waighty affaires, or in excellent works, yet are charged with this affection, and in ſincerity to behaue themſelues in thoſe inferiour duties, <note n="x" place="margin">Col 3, 22, 23 Epheſ. 6, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Seruants be obedient vnto them that are your Maiſters, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh in all things, not with eye-ſeruice, as men-pleaſers, but in ſingleneſſe of heart fearing God: and whatſoeuer ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not to men.</hi>

For the Lord doth not ſee as man ſeeth, he doth not look to the outward action, but he behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with what hart al things are done, and therfore meaſureth according to euery mans deed, whether he be high or low, rich or poore, Lord or Seruant. The beſt hart hath the beſt recompence; the worſt hart hath the worſt wages.

Secondly, this ſerueth as a ſinguler comfort to euery one of vs, that groane vnder the burden of ſin, that feele the weakneſſe of our faith, and are diſmaied at the ſmalneſſe of our ſanctification. Wee know how buſie Satan is to watch his aduantage of our infirmities and imperfections, &amp; to perſwade vs that we haue no faith at all, that we are without repentaunce, without grace, and without regeneration, becauſe we feele great defects, and many wants in our beſt workes, and our beſt gifts. But this muſt comfort vs, that God accepteth of that meaſure that he hath giuen vs, euen according to that which we haue, not according to that which we haue not. A weak faith, ſhalbe as auayleable to apprehend Chriſt, as a ſtrong faith. If we haue a deſire and an hungering after grace, <note n="z" place="margin">Pſal. 145, 15 and 10, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>He will fulfill the deſires of them that feare him, he alſo will heare their cry and ſaue them.</hi> God hath aſſured vs, that as hee hath begun his good worke in vs, ſo he will finiſh his work, and in his good time bring it to perfection. When we finde any dulneſſe and vntowardneſſe in our ſelues, if we hate and diſlike them, and labor to profite and grow forward in ſanctification, God accepteth our willingneſſe and readineſſe, though our ſtrength be not anſwerable to our deſire, or the outward worke anſwereable to our hart. For God is faithful, and will not ſuffer vs to be tempted aboue the ſtrength that he ſhal giue vs; and the Lord Ieſus is a merciful Highprieſt, who will not breake the bruiſed reed, nor quench the ſmoking flax. Let vs al there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore looke that a willing and ready mind be found in vs. Againe, this muſt be conſidered in all things: If we come to hear the word, and to exerciſe the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Gods worſhip, if we do it for faſhion ſake, for feare of the law, for the praiſe of men, or for cuſtom, they are nothing worth; they ought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in obedience to God, in loue of his ordinance, in delight of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in ſingleneſſe of heart, and in an earneſt affection, to the meanes of our ſaluation. The like we might ſay of giuing of almes and liberality toward the poore, if they be not beſtowed with promptneſſe of minde, with compaſſion of heart, and with feeling of the wants of thoſe that craue our helpe, they are nothing at all reſpected of God, nor they that diſtribute the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rewarded of him.</p>

It is not enough to doe a good thing, but we muſt do it well; It is not ſufficient to do thoſe things that are godly, but we muſt do them in a godly manner. Let euery one heerein care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully examine his ſoule, and try his owne heart, whether hee do the duties of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:7222:157"/> his calling vnwillingly, vncomfortably, and vpon neceſſity, for feare of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for auoyding of ſhame, for keeping of his credit, for praiſe of the world, or ſuch like cauſes, which are all falſe motiues; or whether he do them harti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and chearfully as in the ſight of God, before whom all things are naked &amp; open. This is to be conſidered as well of the Miniſter himſelfe, as of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that heare him, and are partakers of his labours. The calling <note n="a" place="margin" type="runSum">The Miniſter muſt preach willingly, and of a readie minde.</note> of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is an high and mighty calling, he is the Steward of God, and a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ouer the people, for whoſe ſoules hee muſt giue an account in that great day of the Lord. It is not enough for vs to labour among them (though wee ſhould worke, and wearie, and toyle our ſelues neuer ſo much) but wee muſt do it diligently and chearfully, as ſeruing Chriſt the Shepheard of the ſheepe. If the chiefe end that we reſpect be to maintaine our ſelues, to liue eaſily, and to increaſe in riches, we haue our reward. Or if we preach vnto them, becauſe the law doth enforce vs, and enioyne vs vnto it, and becauſe otherwiſe the people would cry ſhame vpon vs: if reaping their Temporall things, wee do not giue them Spirituall, <note n="b" place="margin">2 Tim. 2, 4.</note> or if wee ſo intangle our ſelues in the affaires of this life, that we cannot intend the duties of our calling, we cannot poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly pleaſe him that hath choſen vs, to be as Souldiers to fight his battels, and hath appointed vs to be as Shepheards to watch his flocke. It ſtandeth vs vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be ſo touched with a care of our duties, as that if there were no Lawe to compell vs, and vrge vs to be painfull therein, yet the zeale of Gods glory, and loue of his people ſhould conſtraine vs. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaking of his owne practiſe ſaith, <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 9, 16, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Though I preach the Goſpell, I haue nothing to reioyce of: for a neceſſity is layde vpon me, and wo is vnto me, if I preach not the Goſpell: for if I do it willingly, I haue a reward; but if I doe it againſt my will, notwithſtanding the diſpenſation is committed vnto mee.</hi> Whereby we ſee, he ſheweth, that ſuch a neceſsity of the diuine calling, did preſſe ſore vppon him, that he muſt preach or periſh. For, if he held his peace, and did not do his duty, the curſe of God would lye hard and heauy vpon his ſhoulders, and bring ſuch intollerable torments vpon him, as ſhould make him cry out, wo, woe, alas, alas, what a wretch am I? yet notwithſtanding this neceſsitie, hee muſt haue a willing minde, and do his duty gladly. A good work done wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, is made much better by the willing doing.</p>

No man therefore hath done his duty, or diſcharged his calling, that worketh againſt his wil. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> the Prophet went to <hi>Niniuie</hi> againſt his will, <note n="e" place="margin">Ion. 1, 3, and 4, 2, and 2, 1.</note> he could haue wiſhed that his preaching had taken no effect, ſo that he was chaſtned of God.

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſuch as are hearers <note n="l" place="margin" type="runSum">The people are to do their duties willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> among the people are from hence alſo to learne their duty, to do thoſe thinges that are required of them; not daily, but dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently; not heauily, but heartily as to the Lord. Many ſeem deſirous to haue the Goſpell, but they would haue it of free coſt, and therefore repine at the coſts and charges it bringeth with it. If we giue maintenance to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, not for conſcience, but of neceſſity; not for loue to the Goſpel, but by compulſion of Law; not as a free-will offering to God for the recompence of his kingdome among vs, but as a taxation which we cannot reſiſt to retain with vs, or detaine from them, accounting the Goſpell not a benefit wherein we delight, but a burthen which we ſhould ſhake and ſhift off if wee might; it is our ſinne, and eo acceptable ſeruice vnto God. For God in this reſpect loueth a chearfull giuer. Theſe men are wholly carnall, and regard not the ſaluation of their ſoules. If they haue an Horſe-keeper that dreſſeth their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or a Shepheard that watcheth their Sheep, or an Heardman that looketh to their Swine, or a Cobler that mendeth their ſhooes, they are more willing to conſider him for his paines, and to recompence his labors, then to miniſter to the neceſſities of the Miniſter. They thinke that well gotten that is gotten from him, and that ill ſpent &amp; imployed, that is beſtowed vpon him. Again, as we are to giue them a liberall maintenance chearfully, ſo when wee come to the exerciſes of our religion, wee muſt come vnto them willingly, not vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly; ioyfully, not tediouſly. For as he is accurſed <note n="m" place="margin">Ier. 48, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>that doth the worke of the Lord negligently,</hi> ſo is hee alſo accurſed, that commeth into the houſe of the lord grudgingly and grieuouſly, not as one delighting in the work, but as one diſcoraged with the wearineſſe, whether it be of the way, or of the word. He is an euil ſeruant that doth his maiſters buſines committed vnto him vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly &amp; vntowardly; he is an vnfaithful ſubiect that obeyeth the lawes of his Prince by compulſion; he is a diſobedient child that performeth his Fathers wil againſt his wil, &amp; honoreth him without his hart. So he is an euill and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful hearer, that treadeth in the Lords courts vnwillingly, &amp; reioyſeth not when the time commeth to perform his duty vnto him. It is noted of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, that they trauailing to the place of Gods worſhip, <note n="n" place="margin">Pſal. 84, 6, 10</note> paſſed throgh many dangers, &amp; endured much heat, and ſuffered many wants in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, for the pleaſure that they took in his ſeruice.

                  </gap>, did mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the greatnes of the labor. This made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay, <hi>A day in thy Courts is better then a thouſand other where: I had rather be a door-keeper in the houſe of my God, then to dwel in the tabernacles of wickednes.</hi> Where is this zeale to be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs? Who ſheweth this forwardneſſe to Gods ſeruice? Or whom can a man ſingle out to ſay of him, that no want or weather doeth hinder him from the exerciſes of godlineſſe? Wee are growne vnto that loathing of the heauenly <hi>Manna,</hi> that albeit it fall in the middeſt of our Campe, and round about our habitations, yet wee will not ſteppe out of the doores to ſee it, nor open our mouthes to taſte it, nor ſtretch out our handes to gather it: either the blaſts of winde do trouble vs, or the feare of raine doth hinder vs, or the heate of Summer doth burne vs, or the colde of Winter doth pinch vs, or a Lyon in the way doth ſtay vs, and euery trifle ſtoppeth our iourney. If our heart were in the houſe of God, it would quickly moue our feet to carry vs thither. But where the heart is not, euery member is heauy, and hardlie
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:7222:158"/> drawne to do their dutie. The Deuils do the will of God by conſtraint, and againſt their wils, it muſt be otherwiſe with vs. Where the heart is, there is our delight. The Prophet deſcribing the flouriſhing eſtate of the Church, ſayth, <note n="o" place="margin">Pſal. 10, 2, 3</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord ſhall ſend the rod of thy power out of Sion, bee thou Ruler in the middeſt of thine enemies: thy people ſhall come willingly at the time of aſſembling thine Armie in holy beauty, the youth of thy wombe ſhall bee as the Morning Dew.</hi> Where he ſheweth, that the people of God were wont to come to the hearing of the word, to the partaking of the Sacrifices, to the receiuing of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to the exerciſes of Religion, they aſſembled and gathered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues together freely and of their owne accord, to preſent themſelues before the Lord. This duty is required of vs, we muſt come willingly to Chriſt, to heare him ſpeake vnto vs. It is one vertue to come into the houſe of God, but to come chearfully and comfortably as to a feaſt, is a double vertue, and that which giueth life vnto her comming. If we come vnwillingly, and be drawn to our duty on the Lords day, either by ſhame of the world, or by fear of law: we come as dead men that are without working of the ſpirit, or deſire of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, or feeling of comfort, or encreaſe of Faith, or bettering of obedience. If the danger of law did not more compel the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then the conſcience of their duty or the loue of religion allure them, many among vs would ſildome or neuer keep the Lords Saboths, nor attend vpon his ordinances: they com to them as willingly as the Beare goeth to the ſtake, &amp; as chearfully as the malefactor paſſeth to the place of execution. Hence it is, that ſome come to this place once a month, others once a quarter, others only vpon high daies &amp; ſolemne feaſts, more I think to ſhew themſelus, then to labor to ſaue their ſouls. Such was the zeale of our brethren to the goſpell in the daies of perſecution, that they went more willingly to the fire &amp; flame, then theſe men in the dayes of peace com to the hearing of the word, and to the houſe of prayer. They were more chearful in ſuffring of death, then theſe are in ſeeking the means of life. Hence it is, that ſome linger ſo long before they come, &amp; are afraid they ſhall be there too ſoon. Others, when they are preſent, giue litle attention, &amp; not at al regard to profit themſelues. Others, are ready to depart and be gone before the aſſembly is diſmiſſed, and think they haue learned enough. Theſe are they that think they are at liberty to do what they liſt, &amp; to go and com when they liſt. They make no conſcience to begin &amp; end the exerciſes of religion toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo profit accordingly, hauing litle more knoledge then brute beaſts.</p>

They neuer looke to their harts to purge them, nor to their affections, to order them aright, when they come to the ſeruice of God. If they can ſay, oh we haue heard the worde, we haue bin at the church, we haue prayed to God, they think al is well, and that God can require no more at their hands. They dreame the whole ſeruice of

                  <hi>Giue not grudgingly, or of neceſſitie, and God is able to make all graces to abound toward you, yet yee alwayes hauing all ſufficiencie in all things, may abound in euery good work, As it is written, he hath sparſed abroad and hath giuen to the poore: his beneuolence remaineth for euer.</hi> Such as liued in the Church, in the dayes of the Apoſtles, when there were many poore, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny extreamly poore, <note n="z" place="margin">Acts 4, &amp; 5, 2</note> were moued to be liberall, yea very liberall and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull vnto them, ſo that they that had poſſeſsions ſolde them and diſtributed them, as euery one had neede. Many of them no doubt had wiues &amp; Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and were burthened with charge and family of their owne, yet they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted nothing peculiarly their owne, but they had all things common, they had them not only for themſelues, but for their brethren. To conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we muſt beware wee be not led aſide by the ſubtlety of Satan, and the corrupt immagination of our owne Nature, to bee hindered thereby, from practiſing ſuch duties as are required at our hands. He that wil not follow the calling of God, vntill the fleſh miniſter no obiection againſt it, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue the commendation of obedience. He ſhal neuer go about any good duty, but we ſhall finde ſomwhat ſtand in the way to croſſe it, either our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or profit, or ſomewhat elſe will round vs in the eare, to make vs forſake it, or delay it, or condemne it. When the word of God reproueth any ſinne in vs, that ſeemeth ſweete vnto the fleſh, we ſhall meete with a thouſand ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to perſwade with vs to continue in it with greedineſſe, and to follow after it with all eagerneſſe. Wherefore, ſo ſoone as wee know the will of our heauenly Father, let vs prepare our ſelues to do it, and to delight in it, and ſtep ouer the rockes of offence, that ſtand before vs to make vs fall; that ſo God may be delighted with vs, &amp; take pleaſure in our obedience proceeding from the heart.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The order of the words.</note> IN the words going before, we haue already handled the remoouing of the firſt Obiection which ariſeth from <hi>Paules</hi> ſending of <hi>Oneſimus</hi> back againe to his Maiſter. The next Obiection is touching his departure from his Maiſter, mentioned in theſe two Verſes, wherein hee both aunſweareth the Obiection, maketh a newe reaſon, and ſeeketh to extenuate the diſpleaſure
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:7222:159"/> that <hi>Philemon</hi> hadde conceiued againſt him. The Apoſtle aunſwereth heere in this place, that Obiection which might bee made and mooued from the former matter of this ſuit. Hee hath intreated <hi>Philemon</hi> (as we haue heard) to receiue <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> he might hereunto haue ſaid; But why ſhould I receiue him? Shall I entertaine a Runna-gate Seruant, a baſe Varlet, that hath waſted and purloyned my goods, and ſought to vndoe me? If hee were well with me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, why did he depart from me? If not well, why will he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to me againe? Hee that is once euill, is alwaies preſumed to be euill. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere:</note> This is the Obiection: whereunto the Apoſtle maketh a double anſwere, as he did before: firſt, by way of granting and yeelding to <hi>Philemon:</hi> ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by a kind of correcting his former grant. The granting is, I confeſſe and acknowledge willingly, that hee departed from thee, and would not tarrie with thee. The correcting is, though he did depart, it was not for euer, it was but a very ſhort time, as thou ſeeſt. So then, the anſwer is from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynt of time, he went from thee for a little ſeaſon, which is not barely ſet downe, but with an illuſtraſtion added vnto it from the ende, [<hi>That thou ſhouldſt receiue him for euer:</hi>] which alſo is enlarged by a compariſon from the greater; <hi>Not ſo much as a Seruant, but as more then a Seruant.</hi> The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of this enlargement, being the ſecond part of the compariſon, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by the ſpeciall [<hi>A beloued Brother</hi>] more then a Seruant, for a Brother carryeth with it a better reſpect, and a farther regard then the name of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant. This alſo is enlarged by a compariſon from the greater to the leſſe, eſpecially to mee, which compariſon alſo is amplified by another from the greater, how much more to thee, which is farther ſtrengthned by a diuiſion or diſtribution of the Subiect, ſhewing wherein he was more bound to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon</hi> then to <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe; <hi>Both in the fleſh and in the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we haue ſeene the reſolution of theſe Verſes, <note place="margin" type="runSum">The meaning of the wordes.</note> and the order which is propounded in them. Now let vs ſee what are the points that require in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. Firſt, he ſaith; [<hi>He departed</hi>] he vſeth a kind of diminution, called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or a qualification of his fact and fault committed againſt his Maiſter. For he vſeth a more gentle and friendly word to leſſen the offence, that it might not appeare to <hi>Philemon</hi> ſo great as it was, calling his running away, a departure from his Maiſter. Now the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>It may be that he departed,</hi> or peraduenture he departed. The word, vſed in this place, is alſo found. Rom 5, 8. where he ſaith; <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 5, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Doubtleſſe one will ſcarce dye for a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man, but yet for a good man it may be that one dare dye.</hi> Properly <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> it ſignifieth quickly or ſpeedily, or haſtily: but that ſignification cannot fitly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to theſe places, and therefore it muſt be turned and tranſlated [<hi>It may be he departed.</hi>] Where the Apoſtle doth not ſpeake of this ſecret worke of God preciſely and peremptorily, but with an exception or limitation, warily and reuerentlie, leaſt offence ſhould be taken, and encouragement giuen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to the committing of euill. For if he had ſaid ſimply and abſolutely, he departed for this end, and he fled away that he might be conuerted: other Seruants might haue beene emboldned in wickedneſſe, and haue pretended the ſame cauſe, and haue runne away from their Maiſters: who, beeing as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the cauſe why they tooke them to their heeles, would readily anſwere; It was that I might be conuerted to the Faith, as <hi>Oneſimus</hi> was: hee ran away from his Maiſter, and was ſaued; I ranne away alſo that I might be ſaued. So then, the Apoſtle by this word, noteth out the ſpeciall prouidence and meere goodneſſe of God, ordering and gouerning this Fact, which is not to bee drawne into a generall practiſe. In the next place he addeth [<hi>For a ſeaſon:</hi>] the word ſignifieth for an houre, that is; for a ſmall time, euen ſo much as <hi>Oneſimus</hi> was trauailing from <hi>Coloſſe</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> from his Maiſter to <hi>Paule,</hi> by whom being conuerted, he was immediatly ſent backe, which was no long time, but a very little while, euen as it were an houre, in compariſon both of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:7222:160"/> the time that he before had beene with him, and of the time hee was like to ſtay with him hereafter. Wherein alſo he ſeeketh farther to leſſen his fault &amp; offence by the circumſtance of the time, as if he ſhould ſay; If he had beene from thee any long time, or that thou hadſt miſſed him many yeares, thy wrath might be harder to be appeaſed; but he hath beene from thee a ſmall time, it is but as it were one houre, and therefore haue patience toward him, eſpecially conſidering by his abſence, thou ſhalt gaine this, that he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer depart from thee hereafter, but remaine faithfull &amp; profitable vnto thee many yeares. Thou maiſt well beare the lacke of him one houre, ſeeing thou ſhalt thereby get the aduantage of many months and yeares. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he addeth, <hi>That thou ſhouldst receiue him for euer;</hi> that is, all the dayes of his life, vnto his death. Thus the phraſe is taken in ſundry places of the Olde Teſtament; <note n="c" place="margin">Gene. 17, 7.</note> when circumciſion is called an euerlaſting Couenant: the Paſſe-ouer is commaunded to bee kept holy by an ordinance <note n="d" place="margin">Exod. 12, 14</note> for euer: whereby hee meaneth a long time, euen vnto the comming of Chriſt in the fleſh. So if a Seruant would not go away from his Maiſter, becauſe he loued him, and was well with him, the Maiſter ſhould take an Aule and pierce his eare through againſt the doore, and he ſhall be his ſeruant <note n="e" place="margin">Deut. 15, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>for euer,</hi> that is; to the yeare of Iubile. So in this place the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>Philemons</hi> Seruant ſhould remaine with him <hi>for euer;</hi> that is, a long time, euen ſo long as hee ſhould liue vpon the face of the earth. Laſtly, when <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, hee muſt be beloued [<hi>In the Fleſh, and in the Lord</hi>] he meaneth, both in thinges apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to this life, and the life to come. In the Fleſh, in regard of his ſeruice which he ſhall performe to his Maiſter, in matters belonging to this Mortall life. In the Lord, in reſpect of the common faith in Chriſt. This is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the words in this diuiſion: wherein (as we noted before) howſoeuer the Apoſtle doth purpoſely anſwere an obiection, yet in this anſwere alſo he propoundeth two new reaſons, to moue <hi>Philemon</hi> to receiue his ſeruant. One is in the 15. verſe, taken from the ſecret worke of Gods prouidence, which may be thus concluded:
<list type="syllogism">
                     <item>
                        <hi>If the prouidence of God haue gouerned his departure, that by occaſion thereof he is changed, for his good, and for thine, that he might bee ſaued, and thou better ſerued: then receiue him againe vnto thee:</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>But the prouidence of God hath guided his departure, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Therefore receiue him againe vnto thee.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon is contained in the 16. verſe, becauſe <hi>Oneſimus</hi> of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, is m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>de a Brother to <hi>Paule,</hi> much more to <hi>Philemon;</hi> and therefore to be loued exceedingly, being bound by a double band; to wit, in the Fleſh, &amp; in the Faith. In the Fleſh, as a Seruant. In the Faith, as a Chriſtian: whereas <hi>Paule</hi> had onely one cauſe to loue him; namely, the common Faith. This reaſon may be thus framed;
<list type="syllogism">
                     <item>
                        <hi>If Oneſimus of a bad Seruant be made a good Seruant; yea, more then a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, euen a Brother much to be loued, then receiue him.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>But Oneſimus is become more then a Seruant,</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Therefore receiue him.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we ſee how the Apoſtle intermingleth Reaſons with Obiections, and Obiections with Reaſons. So then according to the former order and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the words: the ſumme of them is thus much in effect: But thou
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:7222:160"/> will ſay vnto me; He ranne away from me. I graunt indeede, and cannot deny, but that his purpoſe was wicked, and I acknowledge the cauſe that mooued him to leaue thee, and to forſake thy houſe to be very leud; to wit, the feare of puniſhment for his offences, but looke, looke I ſay vnto the end, purpoſe, and counſell of God, in his departure from thee, which appeareth to be farre from the drift and intent of <hi>Oneſimus;</hi> to wit, by his flight to bring him to <hi>Rome,</hi> by bringing of him to <hi>Rome,</hi> to direct him to me in priſon, by directing of him to me, to conuert him to Chriſt, and by conuerting of him to Chriſt, to change him from a bad and leud, to a faithfull and profitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant. What ſaid I, a Seruant; nay, a degree higher, euen a Brother. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider therefore (I pray thee) how many waies thou art to reſpect this my ſonne <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> and to accept of him. For in that he is now ioyned to thee in the common fellowſhip of the Faith, through the great mercies of God in Chriſt, thou art bound to regard him hence-forth, not as an ordinary Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, but as a deare Brother in Chriſt, equall with thy ſelfe in the Couenant of grace, and the inheritance of eternall life: withall, remember how many waies he is ioyned to thee, rather then to me. He is for the common faiths ſake deare, I confeſſe, to me, and tenderly beloued: but he is bound to thee by two bands; firſt, in reſpect of the fleſh, in that he is of thy charge and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, he is thy Seruant, and an helper of thee in the meanes of thy outward maintenance, and withall, in the Lord Ieſus (our common Maiſter) hee is thy Brother and fellow-heire of the ſame promiſes, being together with thee a member of his body. Now the more waies we are bound to any, the more we ſhould regard them: he is deare indeede to me, but he is neerer to thee then me; and therefore he ought to be much dearer to thee, in regard of this coniunction betweene you.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Diuers points to be obſerued</note> From theſe verſes, diuers worthy conſiderations doe ariſe, which are not vnprofitable to be obſerued of vs. Firſt, marke that the Apoſtle entitleth the ſhamefull running away of <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> the Seruant of <hi>Philemon,</hi> by the Name of a departure. If we will ſpeake properly, a departing is one thing, a running away is another thing. For albeit, euery one that runneth away departeth: yet euery one that departeth, runneth not away from his Maiſter, becauſe he may depart by conſent, either hauing leaue and licence, or that the time of his ſeruice is expired. So a little before, verſe 11. he called him [<hi>Vnprofitable</hi>] whereas hee might lawfully haue giuen him an harder Title. This was not done in regard of the offence, becauſe it was ſmall; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his repentance, becauſe it was great. So he ſpeaketh afterward ver. 18. <hi>If he haue hurt thee, or if he oweth thee any thing;</hi> whereas he might haue ſaide, he had robbed him, and ſtolne his goods from him: declaring that we ſhould deale friendly and fauourably with thoſe that are truely conuerted to God, we are not to augment and agrauate a Penitents offences, but to bee gentle and mercifull toward him, as often as we make mention of him. Such as haue repented, are by all meanes to be fauored, we cannot be of too milde a ſpirit toward them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in the Apoſtles anſwere to <hi>Philemons</hi> obiection, we may mark; that we are bound to forgiue and forget the iniuries and offences done vnto vs, when once God hath forguien and couered the ſinnes committed againſt him, and receiued the Sinner that repenteth to mercy: when God maketh all thinges turne to our good that loue him, and thereby recompenceth by a double benefit, the loſſe and damage that we haue ſuſtained.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we may obſerue, that Chriſtian Religion doth more ſtrongly bind all perſons to their particular callings, and maketh the knot greater then it was. For that which hee ſpeaketh heere of a Chriſtian Seruant, euen a Brother, is true of all callings in the Family and Common-wealth. For as a faithfull Seruant is more then a bare Seruant: ſo a Chriſtian King is more
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:7222:161"/> then a King; a Chriſtian Maiſter, is more then a Maiſter; a Chriſtian Father, is more then a Father; a Chriſtian Husband, is more then an Husband: ſo on the other ſide, a Chriſtian Wife, is more then a Wife; a Chriſtian Subiect, is more then a Subiect; and ſo of all the reſt. Great is the Dignity and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence of our Chriſtian calling, <note n="f" place="margin">Col. 1, 13.</note> which (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) is a tranſlating of vs from darkeneſſe, into the Kingdome of Chriſt Ieſus, ſo that it is a royall prerogatiue which they want that are vnbeleeuers.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Apoſtle, notwithſtanding the great account hee maketh of this Seruant, doth not deny ſubiection to his Maiſter, nor exempt him from the condition of a Seruant, but he addeth, [<hi>More then a Seruant.</hi>] He ſaith not, hee is no more a Seruant, but hee is more then a Seruant: ſo that our Chriſtian <note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 7, 20.</note> calling doth not aboliſh pollicy, and politique Conſtitutions, and Domeſticall gouernment: but rather doth ſtrengthen and ſanctifie them. He that is called to the truth being a Seruant, muſt not bee diſcouraged and diſcontented, but reioyce in this, that he is the Lords Free-man.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, when he ſtileth him [<hi>A Brother</hi>] he doth after a ſort ſignifie he is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall vnto him. For albeit, in the Common-wealth and priuate Family, it be neceſſary that ſome ſhould be Superiours, and others Inferiours; and that this diſparity and in-equality among men, be the ordinance of God: yet in the Kingdome of God and in Chriſt Ieſus, there is no diſtinction; <note n="h" place="margin">Gal. 3, 28, Col. 3, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>There is neither Iew nor Graecian: there is neither Bond-man, nor Free-man: there is ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Male, nor Female: for we are all one in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> When God will punniſh ſinne and the breach of his Law, he doth it without reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Such as are in greateſt Dignity and higheſt place of authority vppon the earth, are ſubiect to ſickneſſes, to diſeaſes, to death; ſo that (as the <note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 82. 7.</note> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith) <hi>Ye Princes ſhall fall like others.</hi> That which God laide in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vpon mankind; <note n="k" place="margin">Ge. 3, 19, 16</note> 
                  <hi>In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eate thy Bread, vntill thou return to the Earth:</hi> And to the Woman he ſaid: <hi>I will greatly increaſe thy ſorrowes and thy conceptions, ſo that in anguiſh thou ſhalt bring forth Children:</hi> What Man, or what Woman, can free themſelues from this burthen, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer themſelues from this punniſhment? We ſee the high, ſubiect vnto them as well as the low, the rich as well as the poore, the Prince as well as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. So on the other ſide, when God will beſtow the graces of his Spirit that accompany ſaluation, hee diſtributeth them according to his pleaſure, and reſpecteth not the outward perſon, hee maketh no difference betweene Bond and Free, betweene Maiſter and Seruant, but giueth where it pleaſeth him: which ſerueth to teach patience and contentation to thoſe that liue in lower places. God looketh vpon them, when he paſſeth many times by thoſe that <note n="l" place="margin">Luke 1.</note> are greater in the world; yea, he filleth them when he ſendeth the other empty away.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, we may obſerue, that he ioyneth loue with Chriſtian Brotherhood, and calleth <hi>Oneſimus</hi> [<hi>A beloued Brother</hi>] not onely a Seruant, not only a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but a Brother deare and beloued; ſignifying therby, that where a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian calling is found, there Charity and Loue is as a due debt required: ſo that if any man be conuerted, to become a true Chriſtian indeede, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is made our Brother (who before was a Chriſtian only in Name &amp; naked profeſſion) euen for this cauſe we are bound to embrace him with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter loue. Euery man in his order to be loued, euen he that is no Chriſtian, if it be Turke or Infidell: but whoſoeuer is a right Chriſtian, not onely in ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but in truth, muſt more ſpecially bee loued of vs, and be deare vnto vs, who is neerely ioyned vnto vs as a member of the ſame body with vs, and is to be eſteemed of vs, not ſo much another man from vs, <note n="m" place="margin">Ephe. 2, 15.</note> as one and the ſame man with vs. He that is out of Chriſt, is another from vs, he is diuers to vs, and yet is to be loued as a man, as one that beareth the Image of God.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, obſerue, that the more cauſes there are of loue and coniunction
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:7222:161" rendition="simple:additions"/> one with another, the deerer and deeper ought our loue to be. There are many degrees of vniting vs together, now the more there are, the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees ſhould there be of loue betweene vs. The coniunction betweene the Maiſter and the Seruant in the priuate ſociety, ought to be a cauſe of mutuall loue: but when to this naturall reſpect there is added a ſpirituall fellowſhip and communion in Chriſt, whereby the Seruant becommeth more then a Seruant, euen a Brother with his Maiſter; this requireth a farther degree of loue in them one toward the other. Thus we ſee ſundry obſeruations, and all very profitable offered to our conſiderations out of theſe words: we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand vpon them all, and therefore we will onely ſelect ſome of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall and cheefeſt of them.</p>

                     <bibl>Verſe 15.</bibl> [<hi>It may be that he therefore departed for a ſeaſon, that thou ſhouldſt receiue him for euer.</hi>]</q> In theſe words we ſee, how he goeth about to mitigate the wrath and diſpleaſure of <hi>Philemon,</hi> by teaching him to conſider; that thoſe thinges which were done peruerſely and corruptly, are by the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and determination of God turned to another end. For a ioyfull end and good iſſue in euils, is as it were a remedy offered vnto vs by the hand of God, to blot out offences. <hi>Paule</hi> therefore admoniſheth <hi>Philemon,</hi> that he ought not now to be ſo greatly offended at the flight and running away of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, becauſe it fell out to be the cauſe of good, not to be repented off. So then he warneth, that this departure of <hi>Oneſimus</hi> from his Maiſter, is not to be waied and pondered by his purpoſe and meaning, but by the end &amp; euent which was moſt wholeſome and profitable. For by this meanes hee was brought to the Apoſtle, and by hearing of him, was inſtructed in the way of ſaluation, to the end that afterward he might bee made more diligent and faithfull to his Maiſter. Whereby we ſee, that when he ſaith [<hi>Therefore hee departed for a ſeaſon, that thou ſhouldſt receiue him for euer:</hi>] It is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the purpoſe and intent of <hi>Oneſimus</hi> flying away, who had no ſuch thought or determination euer to come backe to his Maiſter againe, much leſſe to come backe better or a beleeuer: but it hath relation to the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, diſpoſing of his fault and flight to a good and gratious end. <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. All things, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſin it ſelfe, are turned by the prouidence of God, to the good of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</note> Heereby we learne for our inſtruction, that all things (euen ſinne it ſelfe) are by the high prouidence of God turned to the good of the elect. Such is the infinite wiſedome and power of God, that he bringeth euill to a good end.</p>
               <p>We ſee in this place how the Apoſtle maketh the prouidence of God to turne the ſinne of <hi>Oneſimus</hi> to good, and to the benefit of himſelfe and many others. For by running from his Maiſter, he came to <hi>Rome:</hi> by comming to <hi>Rome,</hi> he lighted vpon <hi>Paule:</hi> by falling into his company, he heard the Goſpell preached: and by hearing the word, he was conuerted, which had not fallen out if he had not departed: ſo that his ſtealing and running away, turned by the goodneſſe of God to his great benefit. So the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> turned to the greater gaine and glory of the elect. To this purpoſe wee may profitably conſider the vile and villainous act of <hi>Iocobs</hi> Sonnes againſt their Brother <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 45, 5. Acts 7, 13.</note> who conſidereth that it was done by the maruailous prouidence of God, that being ſold for a Bond-ſlaue, he might be aduanced to that honour and Dignitie, whereby he might nouriſh both his Father and Brethren in the years of Famine: therefore he ſaid vnto them when he made himſelfe knowne: <hi>Be not ſad, neither grieued with your ſelues, that ye ſold mee hither: for God did ſend me before you for your preſeruation.</hi> The like we might ſay of the crucifying of the Lord of Life, he was deliuered into the handes of Sinners through the Treaſon of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and other wicked and curſſed Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for <hi>Iudas</hi> betrayed him, the <hi>Iewes</hi> accuſed him, and <hi>Pilat</hi> iudged him, whereof the Apoſtles ſay.

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:7222:162"/> whom thou haſt annointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Iſraell, gathered themſelues together, to doe whatſoeuer thine hand and thy counſell had determined before to be done.</hi> So then, albeit they wickedly intended nothing but to ſhew their hatred, and teſtifie their enuie in the death of Chriſt, yet God brought another matter out of their mallice, and made his endleſſe mercy to man appeare in his worke of Redemption. God would haue him dye, <hi>Caiphas</hi> would haue him dye, <hi>Pilate</hi> would haue him die, <hi>Iudas</hi> and the <hi>Iewes</hi> would haue him die; but God for our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they for other ends, as <hi>Iudas</hi> for couetouſneſſe; and the Prieſtes for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy. The Hiſtory of <hi>Iob</hi> is a plaine and direct proofe of this point that now we haue in hand: he was robbed of his goods, depriued of his Seruants and Children, through the rage and couetouſneſſe of his Enemies, and by the crueltie of Sathan: the <note n="p" place="margin">Iob 1. and 2.</note> enemies intended heerein to ſatisfie their owne co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe; the Deuill purpoſed to bring the Seruant of God to diſpaire: neither of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aimed at any good to <hi>Iob:</hi> but God that ouer-ruleth and ouer ſwaieth all, had another end, to try his patience, to make knowne his Faith, to try his obedience, and to giue the deuill the foile &amp; ouerthrow. Thus then we ſee, that all things (whatſoeuer they be) are ordered and diſpoſed by the prouidence of God, to the good of thoſe that belong vnto him, euen then when they doe not intend it.</p>

When Chriſt would make a blind man ſee, and reſtore his ſight vnto him; <note n="ſ" place="margin">Iohn 9, 6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>He ſpat on the ground, and made Clay of the ſpittle, and annointed the eyes of the Blinde with the Clay.</hi> A naturall man would thinke this had beene a way and meanes (iudging by humaine reaſon) rather to make a man that ſeeth to be blind, then a man that is blinde to ſee. Chriſt was able to haue healed him with a word, or to haue giuen vnto him new eyes: but he choſe rather to vſe theſe weak means, that in themſelues had no power or ſtrength in them.</p>
               <p>Thus was <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> cleanſed of his foule Leproſie, whereas he imagined the Prophet would come <note n="t" place="margin">2 Kings 5.</note> forth vnto him, lay his handes vpon him, and call vpon God for him, it pleaſed God to worke by other meanes, and to cleanſe him by waſhing ſeauen times in <hi>Iordan.</hi> We ſee this in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing plainer, then in the glorious worke of our Redemption. The Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, <note n="u" place="margin">Hebr. 2, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>By death, ouercame death; by humbling of himſelfe beneath all,</hi>

                  <hi>he was exalted aboue all. By making himſelfe poore, he made many rich.

He worketh not by ordinary waies, by extraordinarie, ſo often as it pleaſeth him. When hee would comfort, he terrifieth; when he would raiſe vp, he caſteth downe; when he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue, he mortifieth; when he would exalt, he bringeth low; when he would make a man rich, he maketh him poore.</p>
               <p>This it is which <hi>Hannah</hi> ſetteth downe in her Song of Thankſ-giuing; <note n="y" place="margin">1 Sam. 1, 6, 7, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord maketh poore, and maketh rich; bringeth low, and exalteth; the Lord killeth, and maketh aliue, bringeth downe to the Graue, and raiſeth vp.</hi> This alſo the Prophet <note n="z" place="margin">Eſay 28, 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Eſay</hi> ſignifieth; <hi>The Lord ſhall ſtand as in Mount Perazim, he ſhall be wrath as in the Valley of Gibeon, that hee may doe his worke, his ſtrange worke: and bring to paſſe his Act, his ſtrange Act.</hi> This is one of the workes, of the ſtrange workes: one of the actes, of the ſtrange actes of God, when he
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:7222:162" rendition="simple:additions"/> turneth euill into good, and ordereth the wicked actions of men to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Name, and the good of his Children.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 2.</note> Secondly, it is the pleaſure of God to confound the wiſdome of Man, that cannot attaine to great matters, but by great meanes. For <note n="x" place="margin">1 Cor. 1, 27</note> 
                  <hi>God hath choſen the fooliſh thinges of the World to confound the wiſe, and GOD hath choſen the weake things of the World, to confound the mighty things, And vile thinges of the World, and things which are despiſed hath God choſen, and things which are not, to bring to naught things that are, that no fleſh ſhould reioyce in his preſence.</hi> God diſpoſeth of all things as pleaſeth him, and oftentimes croſſeth the deuiſes of men. They intend one thing, but God bringeth to paſſe another: they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one end, but he will haue another come forth, to teach mans wiſedome to be but fooliſhneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 3.</note> Thirdly, he expreſſeth his wonderfull loue, making all things that fall out in the world to ſerue his Church. True it is, the Church of God is beſet with many enemies, that as wilde Boares ſeeke to roote it out of the Earth, as the Deuill which is the Captain of this Army, vnder whoſe Banners are gathered together the wicked world, the fleſh, hell, death, ſin; all which multitude as a great hoaſt muſter together, to work the vtter ouerthrow thereof: yet God that ſitteth in heauen, maketh all their endeuours and enterpriſes further the ſaluation of his Church. This the Apoſtle teacheth; <note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 8, 28.</note> 
                  <hi>We know that all things worke together for the best vnto them that loue God, euen to them that are called of his purpoſe.</hi> He bleſſeth their troubles and afflictions, and worketh in them patience vnder the croſſe, humility in ſuffering, and experience of his mercies, and maketh them confeſſe, that it was good for them that they haue been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. We ſee this euidently in the example of <hi>Iobs</hi> troubles and torments that he endured, there were many work-men ſet on worke to waſt his goods, to deſtroy his Children, to kill his Seruants, to afflict his Body, to torment his Soule, all ayming at this to bring him to deſpaire, and all theſe Wheeles were ſet to moue by the Deuill: but the Lord out of their ſinnes wrought his great good; <note n="z" place="margin">Iames 1, 3, 4 Rom. 5, 3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Making tryall of his Faith to bring forth patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope; and hope maketh not aſhamed.</hi> So then, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God is able to work, and doth work, both aboue, and contrary to means that men imagine, ſeeing he confoundeth the wiſedome that is in man, and maketh manifeſt the abundance of his loue to his people, in turning al things that fall out to their good, and making them ſerue them: we conclude, that Gods prouidence diſpoſeth and ordereth all actions, whether they be good or euill, for the benefit of ſuch as feare him, he will make all things that come to paſſe, to ſerue them that ſerue him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection 1.</note> This doctrine of Gods prouidence is a firme piller of our faith, and a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall point of our Religion, and therefore it is throughly to be cleered, and the queſtions to be anſwered that they may be raiſed againſt it. Firſt, it may be obiected, that if God gouerne all things by his prouidence, it skilleth not what we do, whether we doe good or euill, ſeeing his will muſt come to paſſe, and we cannot change it. It ſeemeth no matter whether we heare the word, or pray, or labour to doe well, inaſmuch as his will muſt be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere:</note> I anſwere, that this is a falſe and wicked concluſion, which is founded vpon our owne deuiſe, but doth not follow vpon his prouidence. For albeit, he order all thinges, yet he hath appointed vs to vſe the meanes. It is a great error and ignorance to ſeparate the decree of God, and the endeuour of man which he would haue coupled together. <hi>Rebecca</hi> the wife of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> had heard it from the mouth of God that could not lie, <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 25, 23. Mal. 1, 2, 3.

The like we ſee in <hi>Paule</hi> when he was in the Ship, and the Angell of God had told him there ſhould be no loſſe of any mans life, but all ſhould come ſafe (though with much danger) to the land: yet he ſaith vnto them; <note n="b" place="margin">Acts 27, 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Except theſe abide in the ſhip ye cannot be ſafe.</hi> Chriſt our Sauiour prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to his Father <note n="c" place="margin">Iohn 17, 5.</note> to glorifie him, and yet he was ſure and certaine of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to teach vs, that as we beleeue Gods prouidence, ſo we muſt vſe, and not refuſe the meanes that he hath ordained.

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection 2.</note> If all things come to paſſe by the vnchangeable decree of God, then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is done freely: and ſo the liberty of the Creatures will is taken awaie. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> I anſwere, a thing may be done by the vnchangeable counſell and neceſſary decree of GOD, and yet changeably, and contingentlie, and freely, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of diuers cauſes by which it is produced: ſo that Gods vnchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able purpoſe and mans free will may ſtand together. Wee ſee this in the Hiſtory of Chriſtes Paſſion; <note n="e" place="margin">Iohn 19, 36.</note> the Souldiers brake the bones of the Theeues that were crucified with him, but his bones were not broken. How came this to paſſe? In their owne nature they might haue beene broken, as well as not broken, as well as the Theeues were: and if we conſider the Souldiers, in reſpect of the Nature of their will, they might haue choſen the one or the other. But in regard of Gods will and purpoſe, it was neceſſary they ſhould not be broken, that the Type might be fulfilled, and that the Scripture might be accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection 3.</note> If God rule all by his prouidence, how is it that there is ſo great confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and diſorder vnder the Sunne?

               <p>Moreouer, there is no diſorder in the Worlde in reſpect of God, albeit there be confuſion in reſpect of Men.

                  <hi>God hath made all things beautifull in his time.</hi> Euen thoſe thinges that ſeeme moſt foule and deformed in our eyes, are yet faire and beautifull, being ſent as iuſt and due puniſhments from God, as the execution of his wrath and vengeance, for the wickedneſſe and vnthankefulneſſe of the World, and for the tryall of the Faith, patience, and obedience of his Seruants. When peace maketh vs ſecure, and ſecuritie bringeth a forgetfulneſſe of GOD, an abuſe of his bleſſings, and a breaking out into all exceſſe: are not the Sword, the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and Famine, iuſtlie ſent vpon vs of GOD? When we ſee men thriue by oppreſſion, and get their goods with Couetouſneſſe, vniuſt dealing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and vnmercifulneſſe to the poore; is it not a iuſt reuenge from Gods owne hand, that an vnthrift ſhould ariſe, and ryotouſly was the goods that haue been naughtily and wrongfullie gotten? Marke a little (I beſeech you) the example of <hi>Dauid,</hi> the deare Childe of God, ſo often commended in Scripture. He committed Adulterie with the Wife, and cauſed her Husband to be ſlaine by the Sword of the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> wherein he ſinned greeuouſly, and prouoked the Lord exceedinglie.

For, it ſerueth to reprooue and conuince ſundry perſons, that eyther know not, or knowing, doe abuſe this prouidence of God, whereby he taketh care of all thinges that are in the World, and directeth them to a right end. And firſt of all, we ſet againſt it, and oppoſe vnto it, the dreames and dotages of Atheiſts, Epicures, Libertines, and ſuch like Wretches, who either deny wholy there is a God, or make him ſit as idle in heauen, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are vpon the earth: ſo that, albeit he know and ſee all thinges, yet hee worketh or ordereth not the ſpeciall actions of men that fall out. Theſe are they that pull God out of his Kingdome, and ſet vp Chance and Fortune as an Idoll, and make it their God. We muſt all learne and confeſſe, that the Lord, that is the Creator of Heauen and Earth, is alſo the Ruler and Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of all (euen the leaſt) Creatures.

Wherefore ſuch as reſiſt God, &amp; rebell againſt his law, and ſtriue againſt his will, cannot ſay they haue done his will, inaſmuch as they had no purpoſe to keep his ordinances, &amp; therefore make themſelues ſubiect to all his iudgements.

We hold, we teach, priuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, publikely, by word, by writing, in Schooles, in Churches, that God is not the author of ſin, but the deuil &amp; mans own corrupt wil: &amp; whoſoeuer teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and preacheth otherwiſe, if it were an Angell from heauen, we hold him accurſſed. Hence it is that the Prophet ſaith, <note n="p" place="margin">Pſal. 5, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou art not a God that loueth wickedneſſe, neither ſhall euill dwell with thee.</hi> So the Prophet <hi>Habakuke,</hi> 
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Hab. 1, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou art of pure eyes, and canſt not ſee euill: thou canſt not behold wickedneſſe.</hi> Likewiſe <hi>Zephany</hi> ſaith; <note n="r" place="margin">Zeph. 3, 7.</note>

But how, may ſome man ſay, doth God harden?

               <p>Laſtly, we teach that God doth both order or ordinate the ſinne that is committed, which is nothing elſe but a directing of it as pleaſeth him, that it goe not beyond his will, neither otherwiſe then ſeemeth good in his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Sometimes he reſtraineth it that it ſhall not paſſe nor proceed farther then he appointeth, who giueth bounds vnto the Sea.

The Deuill deſired nothing more then to deſtroy body and ſoule, but God reſtrained his rage, &amp; appointed how far he ſhould goe, and what hee ſhould not doe, and wrought <hi>Iobs</hi> greater good by his greateſt mallice. Sometimes alſo hee maketh way for ſinne to paſſe, that thereby he may punniſh one ſinne with another. And doth not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teach as much?

               <p>The firſt entrance of ſinne into the World, was by the voluntarie action of mans will corrupting it ſelfe, God inſpiring or infuſing no euill into it. To conclude, let vs know, that as we all agree that euery Act is of God, ſo wee muſt take a difference between the action, &amp; the euil that is in the action. The action it ſelf is of God, but the defect or diſorder of the action, is from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, which beeing corrupt, can it ſelfe bring foorth nothing but that which is corrupt. If a man ſpurne forward a lame Horſe that halteth down right, in that he mooueth and goeth it commeth from the Rider, but in that he halteth, it is from the Horſe himſelfe. If a man cut with an euill Knife, he is the cauſe of the cutting, but not of euill cutting, but the badneſſe of the Knife is the cauſe. Or as a cunning Muſition, that plaieth vpon an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that iarreth and is out of tune, the ſound is from him that playeth, who obſerueth due proportion of time, and a right order of ſtriking, but in that it iarreth, it is in the Inſtrument it ſelfe. The like we muſt hold of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence ouer wicked men and Angels, and all their actions, hee putteth no wickedneſſe into them, but he ordereth and gouerneth that which he find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in them, and bendeth it by his infinite wiſedome and power to a farre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end then the euill Inſtrument intended. The whole cauſe of ſin is true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly in Satan, and in our ſelues.</p>

For the Deuill is the Lordes Seruant or ſlaue, to worke his will, albeit he do it vnwillingly and by compulſion. The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 16, 8.</note>

               <p>Moreouer, let vs depend vpon him for the time to come, aſſuring our ſelues that he will not leaue vs, nor forſake vs. He giueth vs euery day experience of his mercies, ſo that by remembrance of benefits receiued from him, wee cannot doubt of his fauour toward vs. Laſtly, this ſhould bee a very ſtrong reaſon vnto vs, not to be vnmeaſurably diſmayed, nor exceſsiuely offended, when offences and great euils breake out among vs, as oftentimes it falleth out; whereby many are ready to ſhrinke backe, and others are much diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſee the Church of God ſo troubled. We are not to thinke it ſtrange, or to forſake the faith through theſe ſcandals: for God would not ſuffer any euill to come to paſſe, vnleſſe out of that euill hee were able to bring good; and out of that ſinne to bring forth righteouſneſſe, to the glory of his great name, and for the ſaluation of his deere Church. Hee would neuer haue left <hi>Adam</hi> vnto himſelfe, if he had not determined out of his fal, to gaine praiſe to himſelfe, and to prouide better for his people.

We haue indeede many excellent reaſons, and notable Meditations to mooue vs to put vp wronges that are done vs, and to roote out of our hearts the weede of reuenge; and inſtead thereof, to ſet the ſoueraigne plant of patience and long-ſuffering, brought out of the Garden of God, which is the Scripture, that it may growe and flouriſh among vs. And neuer was there more need of them, neuer was there leſſe practiſe of them; for nowe the manner is, (as one <note n="r" place="margin">
                     <hi>Perk.</hi> on Gal. 5, 22.</note> truely ſpeaketh) a word and a blow, a worde and a ſtabbe, a word and a Writ. Hee that hateth his Brother, <note n="ſ" place="margin">1 Iohn 3, 15. Iames 1, 19.</note> is a Man-ſlayer, for raſh anger, is the Fore-runner of murther, and a degree and ſteppe to murther. God is of a patient Nature, and ſlowe to anger; Chriſt Ieſus <note n="t" place="margin">Math. 11, 29</note> is meeke and lowly, whoſe example we ought to remember, that we may repreſſe all chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and ſo finde reſt vnto our ſoules: for hee forgiueth more to vs, then we
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:7222:166" rendition="simple:additions"/> can forgiue to others. The wrath of God hangeth ouer all their heades that retaine wrath; for ſuch as will not forgiue, are in danger neuer to bee forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, ſeeing we aske forgiueneſſe, as we our ſelues do forgiue. It is a proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of loue to ſuffer and beare, and it is a note of iniuſtice to reuenge our owne quarrels; for we take away the honour of God, and make our ſelues the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that receiue wrong, the witneſſes that accuſe, the Iudges that condemne, and the Executioners that punniſh, which is againſt all Lawe of God and Man.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, al wrongs done to vs by wicked men, come by Gods prouidence, to which we are to ſubmit and ſubiect our ſelues, knowing what he is able to do, and what he hath promiſed to do toward vs, euen make all things fal out for our comfort and ſaluation. When <hi>Saule</hi> perſecuted <hi>Dauid</hi> in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and had encloſed and compaſſed him round, ready to fall vppon him, <note n="u" place="margin">1 Sam. 23, 27, 28.</note> there came a Meſſenger to <hi>Saule</hi> ſaying, <hi>Haſt thee and come, for the Philiſtims haue inuaded the Land: Wherefore, Saule returned from purſuing Dauid, and went againſt the Philiſtims.</hi> They were the meanes of <hi>Dauids</hi> deliueraunce, but they had no purpoſe to do him good, or to deliuer him out of the hands of Saule, or to free him out of trouble; for their intent was wicked, ambition moued them, malice carried them, reuenge furthered them, and couetouſnes reſolued them to go to worke, and inuade the Iſraelites. Neuertheleſſe, the Lord vſed their vnlawfull act to his owne glory, and ouer-ruled them to doe that which they neuer dreamed, euen to be the Inſtruments of preſeruing <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> that was neere to death.</p>
               <p>To conclude, by all theſe things it appeareth, that the Doctrine of Gods prouidence, is the ground of all godlineſſe; but where it is denied, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Religion is pulled aſunder. For, vntil we know and conſider, that nothing hapneth by hap-hazard, but all things are ſwayed by the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the moſt higheſt, <note n="x" place="margin">Pſal. 29, 3. &amp; 147, 8. &amp; 136, 25. and 33, 16. and 75, 7.

And thus much of Gods prouidence in the departure of <hi>Oneſimus</hi> out of the houſe of <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> which beeing euill, God turned it to good as well of him that depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as of him from whom he departed.</p>

                  <q rend="inline">[<hi>That thou ſhouldeſt receiue him for euer.</hi>]</q> Heere we ſee, that the Apoſtle to a loſſe of ſmall continuance, oppoſeth a perpetuall vſe, that the Mayſter ſhould gaine of his ſeruant. For to perſwade him to patience in regard of his loſſe and hinderance, and to preuaile with him to be reconciled toward him that had ſo offended him, and cauſed his loſſe; he doth aſſure him of gaine &amp; aduantage; namely, that his ſhort departure ſhould recompence him ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, with a continuall poſſeſſing of him, beeing aſſured to retaine him for euer. <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Doctrine</hi> 2. God taketh from his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants outward commodities, to beſtow vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> We learne from hence, that God doeth oftentimes take away from his ſeruants, many outward and earthly commodities, to the end hee might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow vpon them, both mo and greater bleſsings. When the Mother is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to weane her childe, and take away the breſt from him, it is not to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh him, but to giue him a dyet and food that is fitter for him. So when it pleaſeth God to deny to his ſeruants ſuch bleſsings as they deſire, he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſeth the wants of them with benefits of a more high and heauenly nature. This we ſee in the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he was ſent by the calling of God out of his Countrey, from his Kindred <note n="y" place="margin">Gen. 12, 2.</note> and Fathers houſe, there was giuen to him and his poſterity, the whole Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> yea, God entered into a Couenant with him to be his God, and to acknowledge his poſterity to
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:7222:167"/> be his people; ſo that albeit he wanted the pleaſure of his Countrey, and the delight of his Kindred, yet he gained the friendſhip and fauour of GOD by obeying his calling and commandement. We ſee this in <hi>Iacob,</hi> he was robbed of his ſonne <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> by the treachery of his ſons, and liued a long time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him whom he ſo much deſired; yet in the end he beheld him in glory and dignity, and bleſſed him &amp; his poſterity. We ſee the ſame in <hi>Ioſeph</hi> himſelfe, he was caſt out of his Fathers houſe by his brethren, hee was ſolde into the hands of ſtrangers, he was caſt into cloſe priſon, he endured many ſlanders, <note n="z" place="margin">Gen. 37, 28</note> troubles, and croſſes that fell vpon him, but he bare them patiently by Faith, and in the end he was deliuered, and became Ruler ouer the Land of Egypt. He wanted his Father, and his Father wanted him for a ſeaſon, but in the end they were reſtored either to other, with full aduantage. Let vs ſet before our eyes the example of <hi>Iob,</hi> he loſt his Goods, his Children, his Seruantes, his Cattle, he became poore, and yet was patienr, <note n="a" place="margin">Iob. 41, 10. Iames 5, 11.</note> and in the end God made an happie yſſue of all his afflictions, ſo that hee had them doubled and reſtored vnto him two fold. Our Sauiour Chriſt beateth vpon this point, teaching his Diſciples, <note n="b" place="margin">Math. 19, 29 Mar. 10, 29, 30</note> 
                  <hi>Whoſoeuer ſhall forſake houſes, or Bretheen, or Siſters, or Father, or Mother, or Wife, or Children, or Lands, for my Names ſake, hee shall receyue an hundred fold more, and shall inherit euerlaſting life.</hi> For when <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to the Lord, <hi>Loe, we haue forſaken all, and followed thee,</hi> Chriſt anſwered him; <hi>Verily, I ſay vnto you, there is no man that hath forſaken Lands or houſe, &amp;c. for my ſake and the Goſpels, but he shall receiue an hundred fold now at this preſent, houſes and brethren, and Siſters, and Mother, and Children, and Lands, with perſecution, &amp; in the world to come, eternall life.</hi> This appeareth farther vnto vs, in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the rich Glutton, and poore <hi>Lazarus,</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Luke 16, 20.</note> one of them was clad in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and fared deliciouſly euery day; the other, lay at the rich mans gate, who was not admitted to his Table, and continued without the doores, who was not admitted into his houſe: God denied vnto him the bleſsings of this life, but he gaue him the riches of faith, and receiued him into eternall glory. All theſe places of Scripture, and examples of the godly, teach vs, that God deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto his Children the things of this life, doeth it not, becauſe hee hateth their perſonnes, or enuyeth their good, or purpoſeth their deſtruction, but rewardeth the lacke and loſſe of bodily things with ſpiritual; of earthly thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with heauenly; of tranſitory thinges with eternall; of leſſer thinges with greater.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 1.</note> Thus the Doctrine is made plaine by theſe teſtimonies, but will bee made much plainer, if we conſider the Reaſons following. Firſt, the looſing of theſe outwatd things for a good cauſe, is as the ſeede ſeaſon when wee ſowe our Corne, looking for a plentifull Harueſt, as an after bleſsing. There is that ſcattereth, and more is encreaſed, as the wiſeman ſpeaketh. So the ſcattering away, and looſing of the commodities of this life, and the pleaſures thereof, when God requireth it at our hands, and calleth for it, ſhall be no loſſe, but a gaine; no hinderance, but a benefit; no pulling of vs down, but a ſetting of vs vp; no vndoing of vs, but an enriching of vs for euer. This is it which the Pſalmiſt ſetteth downe, ſpeaking of the returne of the people out of captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 126, 1, 5, 6.</note>

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:7222:167" rendition="simple:additions"/> thing to bleſſe and encreaſe, to reſtore and multiply the good things giuen vnto vs. When God would comfort <hi>Abraham</hi> whom hee had brought out of <hi>Vr</hi> of the <hi>Caldees,</hi> to dwell in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> he ſaid vnto him, <note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 12, 2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>I will make of thee a great Nation, and will bleſſe thee, and make thy name great, and thou ſhalt be a bleſſing; I will alſo bleſſe them that bleſſe thee, and curſſe them that curſe thee, and in thee ſhall all families of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> If then he will reſtore that which he hath taken away, and make vp the breach that his hand hath made, we cannot doubt of his liberality toward vs. The poore widdow had but an handfull of Meale in a barrell, and a litle Oyle in a Cruze, but they were encreaſed, not waſted; multiplyed, not diminiſhed, vnto the time that the Lord ſent raine vpon the earth, 1 Kings 17, 14. Whether therefore wee conſider, that the loſſe ſuſtained for Chriſts ſake, and the Goſpell, is rather a ſowing then a looſing, and a laying vp, rather then a ſcattering abroade; or whether we conſider, that God is rich in mercy, and the moſt bountifull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of his ſeruants; in both reſpects we conclude, that leſſer bleſſings are ſometimes taken from vs, that we may haue greater ſupplied vnto vs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our gaine is made better then our loſſe.</p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1</note> This Doctrine being duly waighed, will be very profitable both to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ſuch as are in trouble, and to inſtruct ſuch as are ignorant, and to direct ſuch in their obedience, as wander out of the right way. Firſt, let this be our comfort, when we ſuſtaine any loſſes, or feele any wants, though they be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo great, though we muſt depart from lande and life, yet in this caſe, it ſhall be a gaine and aduantage vnto vs. For to gain and ſaue where we ought not, is a certaine loſſe. This gaine is little, but the loſſe is great; it is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy temporall things, and to looſe eternall; it is a getting of the earth, and a looſing of heauen; a getting of ſubſtance, and a looſing of the ſoule. Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is this gaine, and wretched is the lucre that is thus dearly bought &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed. On the other ſide, to bee content to forſake and renounce all for Chriſts ſake, ſhall in the end bring with it aſſured and perpetuall riches. For, what is it that we haue not receiued? It is God that hath made vs, &amp; not we our ſelues; it is he that hath enriched vs, and not we our ſelues; and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we haue, whether it be much or little, we haue it not of our ſelues; and therefore we hold all of him, as Tenants at will, he may re-enter and diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe vs of them when it pleaſeth him, ſo that we muſt render them vp into his hands, when he calleth for them, and be reſolute to leaue them, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth them of vs.</p>
               <p>Let vs not therefore ſhrinke backe for feare of trouble and perſecution, but ſet before vs the example of Chriſt, who hath gone before vs, <note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 12, 2.</note> he for the ioy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſſe, and deſpiſed the ſhame, and is ſet at the right hand of the throne of God.

So then, howſoeuer we be afflicted and made ſorrowful for a ſeaſon, yet the time will come, when our ſoules ſhall be comforted, and we haue our heads lifted vp, which bleſſed day, wee ought to attend with all patience, and deſire with earneſt Prayer.</p>

I anſwer, that al Gods promiſes concerning earthly bleſsings, muſt be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood with a condition, namely, ſo far forth as he ſhall ſee them to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for his glory, and our ſaluation. But ſo far as long life ſhalbe a benefit vnto vs, ſo far he wil giue it; but if in his all-ſeeing, and al-ſerching wiſedom he know it to be better for vs to dy then to liue, to be gathred to our fathers, then to continue with our children, he taketh vs away, and recompenſeth the want of temporal life, with a kingdom of eternal glory. This is it which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle expreſſeth, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Ephe. 6, 2, 3</note> who repeating this bleſsing to come vpon them that honor father &amp; mother, doth not only ſay, <hi>That thou maiſt liue long on earth,</hi> but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>That it may be wel with thee, and thou maiſt liue long vpon earth.</hi> So then, long life is not alwaies a bleſsing, for ſomtimes it is better to leaue the world then to liue in it; to depart out of it, then to inioy it. The vngodly man, the longer he liueth, the greater is his ſin, and his condemnation for ſin. This the wiſeman ſetteth down, <note n="t" place="margin">Eccl. 8, 12, 13</note> 
                  <hi>Thogh a ſinner do euil an hundred times, &amp; God prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his daies yet I know that it ſhalbe wel with them that fear the Lord, &amp; do reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence before him: but it ſhal not be wel with the wicked, neither ſhal he prolong his daies, he ſhalbe like a ſhadow, becauſe he feareth not before God.</hi> Heerunto agreeth the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Eſay 65, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>There ſhalbe no more there a child of years, nor an old man that hath not filled his daies, but he that ſhalbe an hundred years old, shal dy as a young man, but the ſinner being an hundred year old ſhall be accurſed.</hi> Thus then we ſee how to expound the promiſe of long life, which God performeth really, or if he take away ſuch as are godly and obedient, hee recompenceth it more fully
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:7222:169"/> with a better life, and ſo he beſtoweth a great deale more then he taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and granteth a better meaſure then he with-held from them.</p>

But if we conſider the poore man of the one ſide, &amp; the proud phariſies on the other ſide, which of them was moſt blind, and whither of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was a member of the true Church? Surely, God gaue a maruellous light of knowledge to his weake ſeruant, that he was not aſhamed to confeſſe Chriſt Ieſus, acording to the meaſure of grace giuen him: whereas the blind Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were blind, leaders of the blind, &amp; ſaw nothing.

                  <hi>I am come vnto iudgment into this world, that they which ſee not, might ſee: &amp; that they which ſee, might be made blind.</hi> And when the Phariſes which were with him heard, theſe things, &amp; ſaid vnto him, <hi>Are we blind alſo?</hi> He anſwered, <hi>If ye were blind, ye ſhould not haue ſin, but now ye ſay, we ſee: therfore your ſin remaineth.</hi> Let vs not therfore deſpiſe ſuch as haue infirmities or deformities of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nor vpbraid them with them, which are not in their powers to put away; rather let vs take heed of the blots and blemiſhes of the ſoul; to wit, of ſinne, which maketh the greateſt ſcab and ſcarre, and bringeth reproach vnto the perſon. Let vs beware of the blindneſſe of the minde, of the hardneſſe of the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:7222:169" rendition="simple:additions"/> heart, of the wounds of the ſoule, and of halting with God. The blindnes of the mind is a ſin, and the puniſhment of ſinne, ſo that God is offended with it: whereby it differeth from the blindneſſe of the body, which indeede is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine affliction, but it is no tranſgreſsion; it is a kinde of miſery, but no ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; it is a croſſe, but it is no ſinne. But the inward blindneſſe of the minde is in it ſelfe a ſinne and breach of Gods Law, and maketh a man culpable of iudgement, and guilty of eternall death: becauſe none is ſo blinded, but he hath firſt pulled out his owne eyes, and refuſeth the light of the Goſpell offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto him <note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 4, 18.</note> through the hardneſſe of his heart. Againe, this ought to bee a ſpecial comfort vnto vs, and to ſuffice to aſſwage all greefe conceiued for the want of earthly bleſsings, if God haue denied vnto vs the vſe of one or many of our members, as of our eyes, our eares, our tongue, our hands, our feete, and haue made vs blind, or dumb, or deafe, or lame, or maimed, let vs not be diſcomforted or ſink down vnder the burden; but rather conſidering the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence that he giueth vs another way, and the ſupply that he maketh by ſpirituall graces, let vs humbly giue him thankes, <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 5, 29, 30</note> remembring that it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for vs, that one of our members periſh, then the whole body ſhould be caſt into hell. We ſee the holy man <hi>Iob,</hi> hauing had great loſſes and dammages brought vpon him to his great hinderance and decay in earthly thinges, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the hand of God in it, &amp; gaue him the glory, ſaying, <note n="c" place="margin">Iob. 1, 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Naked cam I out of my mothers womb, and naked ſhall I return thither: the Lord hath giuen, and the Lord hath taken it, bleſſed be the name of the Lorde.</hi> Hence it is, that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Hearken my beloued Brethren, hath not God choſen the poore of this world, that they ſhould be rich in faith, &amp; heires of the kingdom which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them that loue him,</hi> Iames 2. If God haue made me blinde, yet if hee haue giuen me the eyes of my mind, to ſee the myſtery of faith in this life, and the excellency of glory reſerued for me and all his Saints in the life to come, I haue wherewith to comfort me aboundantly in the want of bodily ſight. If God haue made me lame, &amp; to halt with my foot, and therby want many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pleaſures, that many ſeek and find; yet if he haue vouchſafed this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy vnto me, <note n="d" place="margin">Gal. 2, 14.</note> to make me walk with a right foot to the truth of the Goſpell, I cannot want ſound comfort and inward peace to my own ſoul. God looketh not vpon the perſon of man, he accepteth no man for his outward forme and feature of the body, but looketh vpon the grace and garniſhing of the heart; ſo that albeit we be euery way deformed, yet if we be thoroughly reformed in the inner man, we ſhall bee accepted before him a thouſande times more, then ſuch as haue the greateſt Ornaments of the body, but haue nothing to decke and adorne the ſoule.</p>

                  <hi>Loue is patient.</hi> When <hi>Peter</hi> exhorteth vs, that aboue all things we ſhould haue feruent loue among vs, to the end he may confirm his exhortation, and ſhew that there is nothing more profitable vnto the faithfull, then to maintaine mutuall Charity; hee bringeth this reaſon, <note n="n" place="margin">1 Pet. 4, 8, Prou. 10, 12.</note>

But if hatred beare ſway, men in by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and tearing one another, are ready to conſume one another, to reproch and detract one from another, to ſlander and defame, to ſtrike and quarrel one with another, without meaſure or mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 2.</note> Secondly, we are not alwayes to vpbraid our Bretheren, and caſt them in the teeth with their former fals, becauſe wee muſt account it ſufficient, that
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:7222:170" rendition="simple:additions"/> they haue beene checked and teproued by vs, or by the mouths of many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. The nature of God himſelfe, is gentle toward vs, <note n="o" place="margin">Pſ. 103, 9, 10</note> that <hi>hee will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes chide, nor keepe his anger for euer.</hi> So ought we to deale one toward an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. For, if he doth not deale with vs after our ſinnes nor reward vs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our iniquities, we ſhould haue compaſſion one toward another.

If then it be auaileable to our Bretherens good to haue them reproued, wee ought not to proceede to reuiling of them, and rayling vpon them for thoſe offences which they haue forſaken. This is the reaſon touched by the Apoſtle, mentioning the tranſgreſsion and conuerſion of the inceſtuous perſon, who waſhed away with his teares, the guiltineſſe of his ſinne, he ſaith; <note n="p" place="margin">2 Cor. 2, 6, 7</note> 
                  <hi>It is ſufficient vnto the ſame man, that hee was rebuked of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſo that now contrary-wiſe, ye ought rather to forgiue him and comfort him, &amp;c.</hi> If then, it be ſufficient to reproue; then to reuile and reproach, is more then ſufficient, euen ſuperfluous, and vnprofitable, and vncharitable, as wee noted before.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 3.</note> Thirdly, whenſoeuer our Brethren repent, we are bound to teſtify our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of them, and to bring a cloak to couer the fouleneſſe and deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their offence. But ſo long as wee publiſh them abroad, and proclaime them in the eares and audience of others, it is very plaine we doe not forgiue them: ſo long as we remember them to their diſcredit and reproach, wee do not couer them. It is that reaſon which wee heard before out of the Apoſtle, where he inſtructeth the Corinthians in Chriſtian meekneſſe and moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on toward him that offended and repented that had falne, and was riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; and chargeth them to eſteeme it enough that he was reproued, <note n="q" place="margin">1 Cor. 2, 7.</note> ſo that now they ſhould confirme their loue toward him, and freely forgiue him. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore, that loue couereth the multitude of ſins, ſeeing it ſufficeth to reproue the ſinner, and that it is a duty belonging vnto vs, to teſtifye our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of him that ſinneth; we may from all theſe conſiderations, as from euident conſequences conclude, that the ſins of our brethren, committed and repented of, ought not aboue meaſure to be ſtretched and augmented, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mittigated and leſſened by vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> Before we come to the Vſes of this Doctrine, it ſhall not be amiſſe, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere ſome Obiections.

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> I anſwere, the office of a Publican was no vnlawfull calling, and therefore not of that Nature that falleth within the compaſſe of this Doctrine that we haue in hand. True it is, in regard of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of the Office, the name of the Officer was becom odious, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Math. 9, 11.</note> and therefore the Publicans and Sinners are oftentimes ioyned together. Now their Office was, to be Collectors of the Toll and tribute impoſed vpon them by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains which was as lawfull for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to gather, as for the people to pay. Hence it is, that <hi>Iohn the Baptiſt</hi> doth not exact of the Publicans that came vnto him to leaue their office, but exhorted them to beware of bribery &amp; oppreſſions, <note n="t" place="margin">Luke 3, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Require no more then that which it appointed vnto you.</hi> So then, the condition of a Publican, &amp; the proſeſsion of a Chriſtian, may both ſtand together; ſo that a man conuerted to the faith, may hold the office, and bee called by the Name, without any diſgrace of his outward or inward calling.</p>

It skilleth not what they haue bin, we muſt conſider what they are. The Apoſtle reckning vp many horrible ſinnes committed by the Corinthians in the darke night of their ignorance, he ſaith, <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 6, 11</note> 
                  <hi>Such were ſome of you, but now ye are washed, now ye are ſanctifyed.</hi> Where we ſee, he maketh a flat oppoſition betweene their former eſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their calling, and their eſtate after their conuerſion; and ſetteth a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene that which they were once, and that which they are now. He ſaith, ſuch they were, he doth not ſay ſuch they are; they were, but nowe are not, becauſe they had repented. The like we ſee in his affection towards one perticular member of that Church (of whom we ſpake before) while he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in his Inceſt, he chargeth them to caſt him out from among them; but when he heard of his ſorrow for ſin, and of his repentance from dead works, <note n="c" place="margin">2 Cor. 2, 8.</note> he exhorteth them to confirme their loue toward him more and more. We ſee this offered vnto vs in the example of God and his elect Angelles. When we haue ſinned againſt the Lord, and fallen into horrible offences, whereby he is diſhonoured, and our Conſciences wounded, hee ſendeth meanes to turne vs from our ſinnes, and is ready to forgiue vs when we repent; he neuer vpbraideth vs with our iniquities that wee haue forſaken, but accepteth of vs as wee ſtand in the ſtate of regeneration. This ſerueth to reproue two ſortes of men: Firſt, ſuch as are ſo vncharitable and malicious, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer forget the falles of their Bretheren, but euer remember them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them for them. If any of the faithfull haue ſodainely falne into any ſinne, it ſhall alwayes bee laide to their charge, and hit in their teeth, and ſpread abroad from one to another, and bee made farre greater then it is.
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:7222:171"/> Wherein, ſee the peeuiſhneſſe and partialitie of wicked men, who loue their owne, and beare with a boulſter vp one another in wickedneſſe. If the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlie that make a continuall practiſe of ſinne, and haue their whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light therein, doe runne out of one euill into another, without touch of conſcience, without ſhame of men, without feare of God, without turning of the heart by repentaunce: they ſhall finde thoſe that will defend them, iuſtifie them, ſpeake well of them, as if they had committed no ſinne. But if any that are true Beleeuers, haue beene ouer-taken by the ſuggeſtion of the Deuill, and the corruption of the fleſh; one fall of theirs ſhall neuer be forgotten, it ſhall alwaies be kept on foote, it ſhall runne in the mindes and mouths of prophane men, as if it had not beene forgiuen them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a thouſand enormities of lewd and vngodly men are paſſed ouer, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſpoken off. The World loueth her owne, and ſpeaketh well of her owne, euen of ſuch as God abhorreth. As for the Godly that deſire to pleaſe God, it cannot abide them, all their actions are narrowly pryed and ſearched into, and neuer were they ſo much hated as in theſe our daies. Seeing then we haue to doe with ſuch ſharp ſighted Eagels, that behold all, and more then all that we doe, who like deceitfull Worke-men, are ready to ſtretch them vpon the tender-hookes, and like ſlubbering Surgions, ſpare not to make the wound wider then it is, whereas they ought to ſeeke to cure and heale it: let vs looke more earneſtly into our owne waies, and know that we haue a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand eyes fixed vpon vs, and a thouſand mouths that will be opened againſt vs, and ten thouſand eares that are prepared to liſten to any ſlanders and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that ſhall be reported of vs. Thus ſhall we take profit and reape a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit euen by our enemies. Thus we ſee how they are reprooued that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braide men with their ſinnes which they haue repented off, and doe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the change that is wrought in them; not by Men, but by God. He that is truely conuerted, is made a new man, and hath a new work begun in him, ſo that his olde workes are renounced, and no man abhorreth them more then himſelfe, no man is greeued for them ſo much as himſelfe. If then we truely loue our Bretheren, eſpeciallie whom we ſee to be ſorry for their ſinnes paſt, we will thinke of them with all Charitie, we will ſpeake to them with all gentleneſſe, we will haue no euill ſuſpicion of them, wee will not hinder their good Name: ſo that when they are euill ſpoken off by others, we will endeuour to excuſe them, to burie their faultes, and to ſaue their credit.</p>
               <p>True it is, wee muſt not allow of wickedneſſe, <note n="d" place="margin">Eſay 5, 20.</note> nor call euill good; but ſuch as haue offended vs, we muſt beare with them, and deale with them by admonitions, exhortations, reproofes, &amp; threatnings, labouring thereby to heale them, &amp; to giue a remedy vnto them. Now, if ſuch be worthy reproofe and reprehenſion, that remember the offences of their Neighbours, which before they haue practiſed, and now haue renounced: how much more are they to be condemned, that mocke and deride ſuch as haue vnblameable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and are blinde, or deafe, or lame, or any way blemiſhed in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.

And who knoweth what hangeth ouer his owne head? Or what iudgement may fall vpon himſelfe or his?

He turned about and looked on them, and curſſed them in the name of the Lord; and two Beares came out of the Forreſt, and tare in peeces two and fortie Children of them. A greeuous iudgment fell vpon them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:7222:172" rendition="simple:additions"/> the tenderneſſe of their age: and they are made an example vnto vs, to teach vs to beware, that we make not a mocke at the miſeries of others. It is our dutie rather to pittie them, and ſhew compaſſion toward them; to defend them, not to offend them; to comfort them in their affliction, not to lay an heauier burthen vpon them. This is a notable comfort vnto all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, when they haue Children borne vnto them any way blemiſhed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that they doe not therefore ceaſe to loue them, that they ought not to be aſhamed of them, that they ſhould not neglect the education of them, but rather be the more carefull to traine them vp in the feare of God, which ſhall more beautifie them, then their blindeneſſe or lameneſſe ſhall bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to blemiſh them. For it may be, that God will giue vnto vs more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort by them, then by all the reſt that haue the ornaments of Nature. And if we thinke them to bee greater ſinners then other men, becauſe they ſuffer ſuch things, and haue thoſe infirmities, we are deceiued. When the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples asked Chriſt concerning the blinde man, <note n="g" place="margin">Iohn 9, 2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Who did ſinne, this Man or his Parents, that he was borne blinde?</hi> Ieſus anſwered; <hi>Neither hath this man ſinned nor his Parents, but that the workes of God ſhould be ſhewed on him.</hi> So then, theſe wants that appeare in many; as the blindneſſe of the eies, the lameneſſe of the foot, the deafeneſſe of the eare, the baldneſſe of the head, the may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medneſſe of the hand, the ſtuttering of the tongue, the crookedneſſe of the body, the deformitie of the face, or other defects of nature, are not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſins, but infirmities without blame or blot, which are not to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vpon thoſe that haue them. If we be carefull to eſchew the blemiſhes of the Soule, that make vs vgly Monſters, and misſhapen Creatures in the ſight of God, we are bleſſed &amp; happy: as for outward deformities, they ſhall all be done away, when this Mortall ſhall put on immortality; and this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption put on incorruption, ſo that we ſhall bee made like vnto Chriſt our Sauiour in glory.</p>

                  <hi>That there is ioy in the preſence of the Angels of God, for one Sinner that conuerteth.</hi> Thus it ought to be with the members of the Church, when they ſee the encreaſe thereof, nothing ſhould ſo reioyce them, as when an acceſſe is made and added thereunto. If the body had long lacked the vſe of one part, and ſhould ſee the ſame reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto it, would not the reſt of the members much reioyce? Yes, no doubt. So when we ſee one of the Sheepe of Chriſt, that hath wandered farre from the Sheepe-fold, brought home, and following the true Shepheard, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but receiue great conſolation by it. It is a true ſaying, that there are many Wolues within, and many Sheepe without. Some there are that lurk in the boſome of the Church, which depart out of it, and are found to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede no better then Wolues. Others, are for a time out of the Church, and are as ſauage and cruell Wolues, who in the end are gathered home, and are in the number of the Sheepe of Chriſt. Such a one was Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> who was a Perſecuter: ſuch were many that were the Crucifiers of Chriſt, yet were the Sheepe and Lambes that belong vnto Chriſt. When theſe ioyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the Church, and are conuerted vnto the Faith, their former life led in ignorance and blidneſſe, muſt be forgotten, and we are to reioyce at their conuerſion.</p>
               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:7222:172"/>
               <p>Did any of the Church euer reproach <hi>Paule</hi> with his blaſphemy againſt God, with his oppreſſion of the Saints, and breathing out threatnings againſt the Diſciples of Chriſt, when once he became a beleeuer? Did any tell <hi>Peter</hi> in ſcorne and contempt, that he was a denyer of his Maiſter, a Swearer and curſſer that he knew him not, after that he had teſtified the truth of his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by the bitterneſſe of his teares, for his weakeneſſe that he had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?

No man laid any of theſe things vnto their charge, neither were they hated for them.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that the Prophet <hi>Daniell</hi> hauing denounced a great iudgement to be accompliſhed againſt <hi>Nabuchadnezzar,</hi> for his cruelty and oppreſſion, ſaith vnto him; <note n="k" place="margin">Dan. 4, 24.</note>

This ſerueth to reprooue thoſe that regard not the repentance of thoſe that haue ſinned, nor eſteeme of them any whit the better. Theſe were the <hi>Nouatians,</hi>

And if we be commaunded to leaue ninetie and nine in the Wilderneſſe, ſeeking that which is loſt, and bearing it home vpon our ſhoulders: how much are they to be reprooued that keep them from the Sheep-fold that are come vnto it, and barre the doore againſt them that deſire to enter? The Apoſtle ſaith; <note n="n" place="margin">1 Cor. 9, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>That to the weake he became as weake, that he might winne the weake; and he was made all thinges to all Men, that he might by all meanes ſaue ſome.</hi> The Lord Ieſus calleth the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi>

If any ſhould ſay to the Husbandman, follow thy buſineſſe, till thy ground, plough thy fieldes, ſow thy Corne, but thou ſhalt ſee no encreaſe, thou ſhalt gather in no harueſt, thou ſhalt haue no fruit of thy labour: doe we thinke that by this meanes he could be encouraged or ſtirred vp to labour? Or if the Maiſter of a Ship ſhould bid the Marriners in a tempeſt and ſtorme to looke to their Tacklings, and euery one to work with his hands in his place wherin he was ſet, and withall ſhould tell them (when they had done all) that they ſhould neither ſaue the Ship, nor the liues of ſuch as were in the Ship, it were a cold comfort, or rather a certaine diſcomfort.</p>
               <p>In like manner, what ſhould it auaile to exhort and excite any to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to call vpon them to turne vnto God, when in the meane ſeaſon, we barre them from ſaluation, and hedge vp the way that leadeth vnto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, that they cannot enter into it, albeit they do repent and returne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him? So then, there is greater mildneſſe and moderation required of vs, &amp; we muſt labor to ſuppreſſe hatred and malice toward our Brethren, If any be ſudainly ouertaken <note n="p" place="margin">Gala. 6, 1, 2.</note> by the ſnares of Satan, and the ſubtilty of ſinne, let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them with the ſpirit of lenity, conſidering our ſelues, leaſt we alſo bee tempted. Let vs not bee glad at their fals, nor triumph at the victorie which Satan ſeemeth to haue gotten, but rather mourne for them, and helpe them out of their danger. We are commanded in the Law, when wee ſee the Aſſe of our enemy to couch downe vnder his burden, <note n="q" place="margin">Exod. 23, 5.</note> not to ceaſe or falle to lift
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:7222:173"/> him vp: how much more ought we to ſupport the weakeneſſe, to aſſwage the ſorrow, to beare the infirmitie, and to releeue the miſery of our Brother?

For ſeeing wee are not to make the moſt, or ſpeake the worſt of the fals of our penitent Bretheren, it ſerueth as a good encouragement, and a profitable inducement to leade vs and guide vs vnto true repentance, that ſo our ſinnes may be put away. Sinne is as a moſt fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Leproſie, but when we repent, we are cleanſed of that Leproſie.

It is as filthy Mire, that ſoyleth the Soule, corrupteth the Body, and ſpotteth the Garment; but when wee repent, the ſtaine and blemiſhes of ſinne are put out of his ſight, and blotted out of his remembrance.

                  <hi>So that we which were in times paſt ſtrangers and enemies, are now reconciled, beeing made holy and vnblameable, and without fault in his ſight.</hi> If then God doe couer them when we repent, who are we that goe about to vncouer them? If he doe not impute them, why ſhould we lay them to their charge, who haue a diſcharge from God, who hath cancelled the band and hand-writing that was againſt them? If God haue waſhed and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped away the filthineſſe of them, why ſhould any man caſt the mire of them in their faces againe? The moſt expert and excellent Phiſitian, cannot cure a deep wound &amp; a feſtered ſore, but ſome ſcarre will remain, and ſome print in the fleſh is left behinde: but God ſo healeth our infirmities, that he taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſtaine, the guilt, and the puniſhment, that no token, no marke, no ſigne of his wrath and indignation euer appeareth to appall vs, or diſmay vs. This is the great loue and vnſpeakeable mercy of God toward the broken heart and contrite Spirit. He that hath beene an Adulterer, and hath repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his vncleanneſſe, is no Adulterer. He that hath beene a Drunkard, and repenteth of the beaſtlineſſe and abuſe of the good Creatures of GOD, is no longer a Drunkard. He that hath beene an Enemy and hinderer of Gods word, and now loueth it aboue Siluer and Gold, is no more an enemy, but a friend of the Goſpell. He that hath beene a Swearer and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and repenteth of his blaſphemies, is not a blaſphemer. He that hath beene a prophaner of the Lordes Sabbaoths, and now is carefull to ſanctifie them, and ſpend them in holie exerciſes, is no longer a prophane perſon. True it is, theſe men haue beene ſuch, but when they ſee their ſinnes, hate them, forſake them, are greeued for them, and are departed from them, true repentance is as the Fullers Sope to waſh them, and to make them whiter then the Snow. We muſt therefore make a great difference, betweene that which they haue beene, and that which they are. Shall we ſay, that he, who is come to mans eſtate, and hath put away childiſhneſſe, is ſtill a Babe and Suckling, as Infant and Child, becauſe once he was ſo? Or ſhall we ſay, that
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:7222:173"/> hee, who is made a Free-man, and had ſerued out his Prentiſhippe, is a Bond-man ſtill, and vnder the iuriſdiction of another, becauſe that once he was ſo? In like manner, ſhall wee change our Bretheren to be Children in knowledge, to be the Seruants of ſinne, and Bond-ſlaues of Sathan, becauſe they were ſo in the time of their ignorance, before God gaue vnto them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that they might come out of theſe ſnares wherein they were hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Captiues? Nay, I will ſay more, whoſoeuer reuileth and reprocheth him with his Adultery, Idolatry, Blaſphemy, Drunkenneſſe, or Prophaneſſe, that hath fallen into theſe offences, but dwelleth not nor delighteth in them, is a malicious enemie, a falſe accuſer, a ſlanderer and lyer againſt his Brother. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Math. 26, 69.</note> denied his Maiſter (as we ſhewed before) he forſware him, and curſſed himſelfe if he knew the Man, which he did through feare to ſaue his life. But becauſe he went immediatly out of the High-Prieſts Hall, and wept bitterlie, did any of the reſt euer vpbraid him, and reproach him with Apoſtacy, with ſwearing, with curſſing, with his infirmitie and preſumption? All they therefore are led by another Spirit then the Diſciples were, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpightfullie caſt them in the teeth with their ſinnes, which are more odious and greeuous to them, then to thoſe that ſet them afoote, and blaze them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to their diſgrace.</p>
               <p>This is a great comfort, and bringeth wonderfull peace of conſcience to all thoſe that truely repent of all their ſinnes paſt, which they haue followed with greedineſſe: ſeeing, that as God forgiueth them, ſo he will not haue others to charge them with them. For if the Lord and Maiſter of vs all remit them, we are not to charge our Fellow-Seruants with them. If the Prince forgiue, vpon the ſorrow and ſubmiſſion of his Vaſſall, the Treaſon intended againſt his perſon, ſhall the ſubiect dare to call him Traytor, ſeeing the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces pardon is the Subiects protection and diſcharge? If the Father forgiue the Childe his diſobedience, <note n="x" place="margin">Luke 15, 29.</note> ſhall the reſt of his Brethren ſpeake euill of him, and alwaies keepe it in freſh remembrance? If theſe thinges were duelie regarded and rightlie conſidered of vs, we would not lye one houre in our ſinnes, but make haſt to be reconciled vnto God, that ſo we may aboliſh the guiltineſſe and greeuouſneſſe, together with the infamy of them. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle ſaith; <note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 6, 19, 20, 21, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>As ye haue giuen your members ſeruants to vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to iniquitie, to commit iniquitie, ſo now giue your members ſeruants vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to righteouſneſſe, in holineſſe: for when yee were the Seruants of ſinne, yee were freed from righteouſneſſe. What fruit had ye then, in thoſe things whereof yee are now aſhamed? For the end of thoſe thinges is death, but now being freed from ſin, and made Seruants vnto God, ye haue your fruit in holineſſe, and the end euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where he teacheth, that ſuch as continue in their ſinnes, are as dead trees, or as rotten branches that bringeth forth no fruit: but they that are made free from ſinne, are made the Seruants of righteouſneſſe. The Tree that hath a long time brought forth no fruit, when once it beginneth to bring forth good fruit, cannot be called an euill tree. The ground that beginneth to yeelde plentifull encreaſe, cannot be called barren, whatſoeuer it hath been in times paſt. So is it with euery one of vs, we are accounted Trees of righteouſneſſe, and fruitfull ground, ſo ſoone as we lay aſide the vnſauory fruits of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Wherefore, whenſoeuer we heare the taunts and reproaches of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable men, caſt out againſt vs for ſuch ſinnes as we haue long agoe left, let vs not be greeued at them, nor ſorrowfull for them, nor ſeeke reuenge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, but rather comfort our ſelues in this, both that God hath giuen vs repentance to ſee and forſake our ſinnes, which before we made our chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt pleaſure, and that he hath pardoned them in his Sonne, and will neuer lay them to our charge, ſo that he accounteth them as if they had neuer beene committed, and accepteth of vs, as if we neuer had offended him. As for the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:7222:174"/> vngodly, that haue ſinne raigning in them, and neuer truely repented of heir ſinne, they may and ought to be charged with their ſins, and as we find them in the preſent time to be, ſo we may iuſtly account of them, ſo we may truelie call them, and ſo we may cenſure them and pronounce of them. For as it is lawfull to call a Spade, a Spade: ſo he that is knowne to liue ſtill in Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, may be named and noted to be an Adulterer, and a filthy liuer. He that maketh a continuall practiſe of drunkenneſſe, and is reſolued to remaine in it, may be called a drunken beaſt, a drunken ſot, a drunken companion, and we need craue no pardon if we giue him that ſtile. He that regardeth not the hearing of Gods word, but liueth in open contempt of God, and of his ordinances, may be iuſtly branded with the reproach of his ſinne, and may be called the enemy of all righteouſneſſe, and the Childe of the Deuill. We know, that <hi>Iudas</hi> through couetouſneſſe betrayed his Maiſter, and when hee had done, he diſpared of pardon and hanged himſelfe: the reproach of this fact and offence, remaineth to this day, and ſhall neuer be blotted out, but he is called <hi>Iudas</hi> the Traytor, and Sonne of perdition. <hi>Math.</hi> 10. 4. <hi>Actes</hi> 1. 16. 17. And thus the caſe ſtandeth with all other vnrepentant Sinners, that vſe not the remedy appointed of God to bring them out of the ſtate of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, into the way of ſaluation.

They know what they haue committed, but they are ignorant and will not know that their ſins are remitted, and that whatſoeuer the Son of God remitteth, ought not to be retained and remembred of the Sons of men. It is no diſgrace to a man to haue beene wicked and infamous for his offences, if he be throughlie changed and altered: for their reformation giueth them more grace and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour with God and all good men, then their former life doth ſhame and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit.

But howſoeuer theſe men account of ſinne, and whatſoeuer they call it, they ſhall find that the leſſening of it, is the way to encreaſe it, and the diminiſhing of it, is the meanes to make it greater.

This ſheweth the wonderfull abuſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> committed in holie thinges, and thinges ſuppoſed by them to be holie. The Sacrament of the Lordes Supper is moſt horribly propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of them, which being inſtituted in remembrance of the death of Chriſt, to aſſure vs of our ſpirituall communion in him, and of our ſpirituall nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment from him, is often receiued of them to combine them together in wickedneſſe, and to take ſecuritie thereby one of another, not to reueale the Treaſons and Conſpiracies that are plotted among them. Thus it is in the ſuppoſed Sacrament of Pennance, when they would reueale the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den miſcheefe and poyſons of their hearts, to the Prieſtes and Ieſuits their Confeſſors, they will ſeeme to doe it by way of confeſſion, that ſo it might be (as it were) locked vp and ſealed with this Seale, as a ſecret neuer to bee diſcloſed and diſcouered. Thus is confeſſion become nothing elſe but a couer of Treaſon and Rebellion. But when our Brethren being afflicted in Conſcience, and wounded with the Darts of Satan, and the poyſon of ſinne, ſhall accuſe themſelues, and confeſſe ſome haynous ſinne committed that ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth heauy vpon them, and can find no comfort in concealing of it, but grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter horror, &amp; thereby are brought to the gates of Hell; and like to be ſwallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vp in deſpaire, when they ſhall (I ſay) confeſſe to the glorie of God, and the ſhaming of themſelues, the wickedneſſe of their hearts and handes, we are not to vtter it to others to their diſgrace, but by all meanes we can to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it in ſecret and ſilence.

               <p>Laſtly, this reproueth our remiſneſſe and wretchleſneſſe in dealing with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſant Papiſts, the members of the Pope and Popiſh Church, who becauſe we would not offend them, we ſpeake of them honourably, and giue them the Name of Catholikes, and honour them with the Title of the Church: whereas wee ſhould giue them their right, and call them by their propper Names, of Idolaters, and enemies of the Grace of God, and diſturbers of the State. We haue many among vs that are ready to ioyne with them, and to giue them the right hand of fellowſhip, who can bee content to mingle together God and <hi>Baall,</hi> Chriſt and <hi>Beliall,</hi> light and darkeneſſe, the Temple of God, and an Idoll. But as we beleeue the High-prieſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be the very Anti-chriſt deſcribed in the Scripture, ſo we alſo hold that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a falſe and Baſtard-Church, and no true Church of Chriſt Ieſus, who not onely haue ſhaken, but razed downe the very foundations of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, maintaining the worſhipping of Images, and the merrits of workes, by making a mocke of Chriſtes merits and ſatisfaction, by deuiſing other Mediators, and by preſuming to offer him vp an vnbloody Sacrifice to God the Father. Let vs not therefore halt betweene <note n="g" place="margin">1 Kin. 18, 21</note> two opinions, nor go about to reconcile thoſe thinges which can neuer hold or hang together. The falſe Apoſtles would ioyne the Law and the Goſpell together, the workes of the Law, and the grace of Faith in the matter of Iuſtification, which can neuer be, the one deſtroying and pulling down the other: becauſe <note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 11, 6.</note> if it be of grace, it is no more of workes, or elſe were grace no more grace: but if it be of workes, it is no more grace, or elſe were worke no more worke. So we haue thoſe that dreame of an vnion between Chriſt and Antichriſt, but if the Lord be God, follow him; if <hi>Baall</hi> be he, then goe after him.

They that grow in grace, are truly to be reputed and accounted gracious. It is noted in Chriſt, <note n="x" place="margin">Luke 2, 52.</note> 
                  <hi>That he encreaſed in wiſedome and ſtature, and in fauour with God and men.</hi> When a man groweth in ſtrength of body, it is a ſigne his meate nouriſheth him, and doth him good. So when we profit in knowledge and vnderſtanding, in holineſſe and ſanctification of life, it ſheweth that we are good hearers of the word. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith in the <hi>Prouerbs,</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Prou. 1, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>A wiſe man ſhall heare and increaſe in learning: and a man of vnderſtanding ſhall attaine vnto wiſe counſels.</hi> We muſt therefore proceed in good things, that we may be well pleaſed, that we may be enriched in his graces, and eſtabliſhed more firmely in the waies of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. For there cannot be a better means to keep vs from a fearfull Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and to preſerue vs from a dangerous back-ſliding, then to go forward in that iourney into which we are entred, and to make ſtrait ſteps to the place of our reſt. So long as we walke to the end of the race ſet before vs, there is no feare of fainting or falling backward. But when once we begin to ſtand ſtill, and do not go forward, our caſe is to be pittied, we haue giuen roome to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and taken the foile, who will not reſt there, but take farther hold of vs. Whoſoeuer ſtandeth ſtill, and remaineth at one ſtay in matters of Religion, will ſhortly turne backward. The heauenly bodies are euer in motion, it is the earth that ſtandeth ſtill at one ſtay: ſo ſuch as are heauenly minded, are alwaies going and growing toward heauen; whereas ſuch as think vpon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the earth, are ſo cloyed and clogged with that groſſe matter, that they cannot moue a foot forward to lay hold of happineſſe. Hence it is that the Apoſtle exhorteth the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 
                  <note n="z" place="margin">2. Cor. 7, 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Seeing we haue theſe promiſes (dearely beloued) let vs cleanſe our ſelues from all filthineſſe of Fleſh, and ſpirit, and finiſh our ſanctification in the feare of God.</hi> Likewiſe, writing to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">1 Theſſ. 4, 1.</note> 
                  <hi>He ſtirreth them vp, and exhorteth them in the Lord Ieſus, that they increaſe more and more, as they had receiued of them, how they ought to walke and to pleaſe God.</hi> Thus alſo ſpeaketh the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,;</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">2 Pet. 3, 17, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye therefore (beloued) ſeeing ye know theſe things before, beware least ye be alſo plucked away with the error of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and fall from your owne ſtedfaſtneſſe: but grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſerueth to reproue thoſe that either ſtand ſtill or go backeward, and
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:7222:176"/> and are not proficients in the Schoole of Chriſt, who heare much and learne little; who know ſomewhat, and practiſe nothing at all; who thinke they haue gotten enough, and that now they may be idle and ſlothfull. It was not ſo with the Apoſtle, who was a better Scholler then theſe Drones; he labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red euermore to be better &amp; better, as himſelfe teſtifieth; <note n="c" place="margin">Phil. 3, 3, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>I forget that which is behinde, and indeuour my ſelfe to that which is before, and follow hard toward the marke, to the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> He was not like vnto a fooliſh Runner, who running in a Race for a great price, will eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry foote be looking backe how much ground he hath runne and rid, but his eyes were fully fixed vpon the marke, conſidering how farre hee had yet to paſſe, and waighing how much he was diſtant from perfection. It had been better, that we had neuer made profeſſion of Chriſt, or beene called by his Name, then to ſtand at a ſtay, or to ſtart aſide, whereby it may be probablie ſuſpected, if not rightly gathered, that wee neuer had any ſoundneſſe in vs. Let vs therefore <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 15, 14.</note> labour to abound more and more in wiſedome, and in all godlineſſe. Whoſoeuer glorieth that hee hath ſo much Grace as he deſired, did neuer truelie deſire any grace. Whoſoeuer ſitteth ſtill, and neuer inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to goe forward, ſhall neuer come at his iournies end. And whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thinketh himſelfe to be good enough, and purpoſeth neuer to be better, will preſentlie grow to be worſe, and neuer ceaſe vntill that he be ſtarke naught.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, ſuch as haue a care to proceed, and are at the mending hand, though they doe it ſlowly and ſlackely, though they haue many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and defaults, though they feele in themſelues many infirmities and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, yet it is a notable comfort and teſtimony vnto their hearts, that GOD will giue them grace to continue vnto the end, and to perſeuer in the Faith vnto the death. For ſuch doe get ground of their enemies, do wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the force of ſinne, doe ſtrengthen the guifts of the Spirit, and doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit daily in the exerciſes of Religion which they frequent. Secondly, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth ſuch as regard moſt of all, and beſtow the greateſt fruits of their loue and compaſſion, vpon the moſt vngodly and vngratious, which are moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be reſpected. For the more men grow in wickedneſſe and propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the leſſe they ought to be loued and liked of vs. It is true godlineſſe that ſhould ioyne vs in mutuall friendſhip one with another, and vnite our affections one toward another. The more godlineſſe appeareth to bee in them, the neerer ought our coniunction to be with them. And as they grow in good thinges, ſo ought our loue to encreaſe toward them. This the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Dauid</hi> teacheth. Pſalme 15. 4. <hi>Lord, who ſhall dwell in thy Tabernacle, who ſhall reſt in thy holie mountain?</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 15, 4. and 16, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>He in whoſe eyes a vile perſon is contemned, but he honoureth them that feare the Lord.</hi> And in the Pſalme following, <hi>Thou art my Lord, my well doing extendeth not to thee, But to the Saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent: All my delight is in them.</hi> But how many are there among vs, that haue no ſocietie or familiaritie with the faithfull, and ſuch as feare the name of the Lord? That thinke themſelues in a Priſon or in Hell, ſo long as they are among them? That can bee merrie and pleaſant among prophane Companions, but hang downe their heads when they are with the godly, and neuer reſt till they be gone from them. If a Man or a Woman ſhould alwaies delight to be in the company of Beares and Wolues, and to conuerſe among Dogs and Swine, that when you ſeeke for them, you ſhould neuer find them but among the Beaſts, as if they had abandoned the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of reaſonable Creatures, we would thinke them ſtrange bodies, we would wonder at their humors, and be ready to ſay they were of a wild and woluiſh Nature, and (as it were) transformed into the qualities of Beaſtes, like vnto <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who had his vnderſtanding taken from him, and his dwelling appointed among the Beaſtes of the field. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 30. So is it with
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:7222:177"/> thoſe that frequent no company but of wicked perſons, and vſe no ſocietie with any, but of ſuch as are as blinde as Beetels, and as ſenſeleſſe as ſtones, &amp; as brutiſh as beaſts in matters of Religion: may we not truly conclude of them, that they are beaſtlie minded, and like to them with whom they ſort, and to whom they reſort? The Prophet ſaith, I am a Companion of all that feare thee: but theſe may ſay; I am a Companion of them that forſake thee. He ſaith; Do not I hate them that hate thee? <note n="f" place="margin">2 Sam. 6, 16.</note> But theſe men ſay, Doe not I loue them that hate thee, and hate them that loue thee? They hate the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their hearts, and the more grace appeareth in them, the more they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them; as <hi>Michall</hi> did <hi>Dauid,</hi> when ſhe ſaw his zeale in bringing home the Arke of the Lord into his own Cittie. They eſteeme more of their dogs and Swine, then they doe of the deare Seruants of God, bought with the precious blood of Chriſt, &amp; therfore they ſay! Oh, theſe are the little flock, theſe are Saints, theſe are holie folkes, we are not for their company. But if we belong to God and to his Kingdome, wee muſt of neceſſitie be of the Communion of Saints. And if indeede thou thinke them holie, thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to conclude; therefore we are, and muſt be, and will be for their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. For either we are holie, or vnholie; either godlie, or prophane; either righteous, or vnrighteous. If we be not true Chriſtians, we are no better then Deuils incarnate: and therefore ſhall haue our portion and reward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Deuils. So then, either they vtter thoſe words with a ſcoffing ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and then we leaue them to his iudgement that will take vengeance of all ſuch taunts that he accounteth caſt out againſt himſelfe: or elſe they make a fearefull concluſion againſt their owne Soules, diſclaiming themſelues to be Members of the Church, renouncing the ſweet ſociety &amp; communion of the Saints, refuſing the forgiuenes of their ſins, and accounting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of eternall life: or elſe they ſpeake ignorantly, as poore ſilly blind Soules, who are to be pittied and praied for, and this all the hurt we wiſh vnto them for all the mallice they beare againſt vs, beeing bold to craue more good for them, then they doe for themſelues, ſaying; <note n="g" place="margin">Luke 23, 34 Acts 7, 60.</note> 
                  <hi>Father forgiue them, for they know not what they doe: Lord, lay not this ſinne to their charge.</hi> Thus we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire God to giue them them eies that are blind, and to open their hearts that haue ſhut them againſt the truth, and the profeſſors thereof.</p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 2</note> Secondly, ſeeing it is our duty to reſpect euery one of the faithfull, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the grace of God meaſured out vnto him, it is required of all men to looke alwaies to the beſt things in the choiſe of the companions of their life. We learne not to enter raſhly into any neere ſocietie with ſuch as haue not the graces of Gods holie ſpirit to commend them. When any of vs are to ſeeke friendes, to match our ſelues with a Wife, to entertaine Seruants, to make choyce of teachers, our care muſt be to enquire after ſuch as haue true pietie in their hearts, and may yeeld vnto vs ſound comfort. And whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we haue made that happy and heauenly choyce, we muſt labour to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, to encreaſe, and to ſtrengthen them in all their waies, and for our parts, muſt delight and reioyce in them aboue all other. One good Friend, one godly Wife, one religious Seruant, is worth ten thouſand others, what pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges of the fleſh ſoeuer they bring with them. Hence it is that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith; <note n="h" place="margin">1 Cor. 7, 39.</note> 
                  <hi>The Wife is bound by the law, as long us her husband liueth: but if her Husband be dead, ſhe is at liberty to marry with whom ſhe will, onely in the Lord.</hi> We ſee how <hi>Dauid</hi> among all the Sonnes of <hi>Saule,</hi> made choiſe onely of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan,</hi> to ioyne with him in a ſtrong league of ſure friendſhippe, becauſe he knew him to haue an vpright and faithfull hart toward God: Theſe two did take ſweet counſell together, and had their ſoules knit in a faſt and firme knot of mutuall loue. Likewiſe, concerning the ſeruants of his houſe that he would receiue and retaine, he ſaith; <note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 101, 6, 7</note> 
                  <hi>Mine eyes ſhall be vpon the faithfull of the Land, that they may dwell with me, he that walketh in a perfect way, he ſhall ſerue mee:
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:7222:177" rendition="simple:additions"/> there ſhall no deceitfull perſon dwell within mine houſe, he that telleth lies ſhall not remaine in my ſight, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> called to be an Apoſtle, &amp; teacher of the Gentiles, hauing conuerted many to the faith, did take the greateſt delight, and reaped ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt conſolation in them, he accounted them his Crown, he eſteemed them his Sonnes, he called them his glory, he reioyced in them as his hope. This appeareth in the example of <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> whom he had begotten in his bonds, the greater fruits of Faith he found in him, the greater account and recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning did he make of him. The like wee might ſay of others, euen of whole Churches gained to the Goſpell; the more they encreaſed in godlyneſſe, the more his bowels were enlarged in care and compaſsion toward them. This affection ought to be in all true Paſtors toward their people, they muſt loue ſuch aboue the reſt, as exceede and excell the reſt in the knowledge and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of true godlineſſe. This affection ſhould be in the Father towards his Children, he ſhould loue them moſt, he ſhould giue them moſt, hee ſhould prouide and prepare for them moſt, that haue moſt Religion in their hearts, moſt grace in their ſoules, moſt ſoundneſſe in their liues. Let them bee vſed beſt that are beſt, and finde moſt fauour, that ſhew the greateſt faith. The Scripture teacheth vs, that <hi>Iſaac</hi> had two ſonnes; <hi>Eſau</hi> was the firſt borne, yet <hi>Iacob</hi> had the bleſsing. Godlineſſe maketh the younger to bee the elder, the ſecond to be the firſt, the loweſt to be the higheſt, the leaſt to bee the greateſt; but vngodlineſſe cauſeth the firſt borne to be laſt, maketh the elder to be younger, and eaſteth downe the higheſt into the loweſt roome. So we ſee, that among the ſonnes of <hi>Iacob,</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="margin">1 Chro. 5. 1. Gen. 49, 3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had the double portion, albeit he were the youngeſt of them all ſauing one, becauſe the reſt of his Children had ſtained them-ſelues with ſome groſſe ſinne, which did put them out of their proper place, and diſinherit them of the bleſsing.</p>
               <p>This point heere to be learned and practiſed, reproueth two ſorts of men, as well ſuch as make choiſe of ſuch as bee wicked, as thoſe that hate them which are good and godly. We muſt not delight our ſelues in thoſe that be carnall and corrupt, albeit they be neuer ſo neer vnto vs. <hi>Ahab</hi> did repoſe and reioyce himſelfe <note n="l" place="margin">1 King. 21, 7 1 Sam. 22. 9. 1 Ki. 12, 8, 31</note> in <hi>Iezabell</hi> againſt <hi>Naboth; Saule</hi> in <hi>Doeg,</hi> againſt <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> when he ſaw that God was with him, and his ſpirit departed from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. <hi>Rehoboam</hi> made choiſe of youthfull, vaine, and vicious Companions, and refuſed the Counſell of the prudent, and the aduiſe of the Elders, &amp; the friends of his Father. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> made choyſe of the ignorant multitude, of the ſcum of the people, and of the Raſcall ſort, to be the teachers of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> and their guides and Gouernors in the matters of Gods worſhip. It is a common euill to delight in euill company, in prophane perſons, in Idoll-ſhepheards, in carnall friends. The delight that men take in theſe is vaine, and of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue; nay it bringeth in the end Gall and Wormewood, and biteth as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. If thou delight in thy Wife, Children, Seruants, Friends, and Familiars in the fleſh, in a worldly and wicked manner, and neuer conſidereſt from whence thou haſt them, nor receiueſt them as the guiftes and bleſsings of God, that thereby thou mayeſt haue ſound ioy, and true happineſſe heaped vpon thee, it is extream folly and madneſſe. What was the end of <hi>Ahabs</hi> ioy in his wife, in his ſonnes, in his poſterity? They were at the laſt, thogh mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed exceedingly, cut off from man to beaſt, and none of them left to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a wall. How many are there, that being free and at liberty to make choiſe of Friends, of Wife, of Seruants, of Companions, do neuer ſet the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, who hauing little grace in their owne hearts, make an electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch as are moſt vngracious and graceleſſe. They deſire not to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of ſuch as loue the Lord and his Law, but reſpect riches or beautie, or honour, or ſuch outward Ornaments, as periſh with the vſe, and cannot cleanſe the ſoule. Wherefore, let all ſuperiors know and vnderſtand, that it is
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:7222:178"/> a duty and inſtruction belonging vnto them, to delight themſelues, and ſet their hearts vpon ſuch as are religious and vertuous, and to ſhew their anger and diſpleaſure againſt thoſe that are faithleſſe, and feare not to offend the Lord with their wicked liues and vngodly behauiour. For this ſhall bee our praiſe and commendation in the choiſe of our frends, and in the gouernment of our houſes, to follow the example of God our Creator, who is the moſt prudent and perfect Gouernour. His fauour doeth embrace, and his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe compaſſe on euery ſide, ſuch as faithfully ſerue him, and ſincerely wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him: but his wrath and angry countenance is fierce againſt thoſe that walke rebelliouſly in the contempt of his Lawes, and liue licentiouſly in the profeſsion of his ſeruice. Thus ought it to be in his people that gouerne in his feare, ſuch as they ſee feare God they muſt honor, they muſt commend, they muſt encourage, they muſt countenance; but ſuch as are ſtubborne againſt themſelues, and ſtiffe-necked againſt God, they muſt reprooue and reiect, they muſt diſcommend and diſcountenance by all meanes they can. For, all ſuch as ſuffer diſorders and misbehauiour in their charges, without checke and controulement, ſhall finde the faultes of their Inferiours turne to their owne reproach and reproofe. The Wiſeman teacheth, <note n="m" place="margin">Prou. 14, 34</note> that <hi>ſinne is a ſhame to a whole people, and to a great company;</hi> much more then ſhall it turne to be infamous and ignominious to a houſe, and to the Maiſter of the houſe, as we ſee in <hi>Eli</hi> and his ſonnes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it reprooueth ſuch as hate and abhorre thoſe that ſhewe the ſeeds of Faith, and the ſparkes of grace, and the fruits of the ſpirit to bee in them. It is an euill (as we heard before) not to preferre and make choyſe of ſuch as are good; but it is a great deale worſe to loath and diſlike ſuch as are godly, when they haue made choiſe of them, and brought them home into their owne doores. They that haue obtained this mercy to finde grace with God, do bring the bleſsinges of God with them into the houſe, they come not empty and alone, but full fraught and furniſhed with great Treaſures, if that we had ſpirituall eyes or hearts to diſcerne it. <hi>A Religious and a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Wife is</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Prou. 31, 10, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>a great Iewell, her price is farre aboue the Pearles, for ſhe will do her Husband good, and not euill, all the dayes of her life:</hi> and yet many repine and murmure that their wiues haue ſo much knowledge, and that they are too zealous in the truth. They neuer thinke they bring them to much riches and ſubſtance, but if they labour to be rich in God (which is the true Treaſure) they thinke a little to be too too much. They neuer complaine that they are in fauour with great men, from whom they may reape a commodity; but if they ſeek to be in fauour with God, from whom euery good giuing, &amp; eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perfect guift proceedeth, they make a ſcoffe and a mock at it. They ought to encourage them, and ſtirre them vp to good things, and not hinder them in their courſe. They ought themſelues to teach and inſtruct them, &amp; not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them from learning of others. Thus it is alſo many times with many Fathers, that pretend a loue to their children, but it is in the fleſh, not in the ſpirit; in the world, not in the Lord; in earthly things, not in heauenly. If their Children haue embraced the Goſpell in ſincerity, and ſeeke after the meanes of their ſaluation with diligence, they thinke they are too forward, and feare they wil proue too praeciſe, and ſo make more account of others, that are more looſe in life, and prophane in conuerſation.</p>
               <p>This fault was in good <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who preferred his ſon <hi>Eſau</hi> hated of God, before <hi>Iacob</hi> that was loued of him. So do the Fathers of our times, delight themſelues moſt in their Children that are moſt lewd, and ſhew leaſt fauour to ſuch as moſt deſerue it. And thus it fareth with many Paſtors &amp; Teachers of the people, who ought to go before them in ſoundneſſe of Doctrine, and vprightneſſe of life, and by all meanes to bring forward ſuch as are comming on, to ſpurre and ſtirre vp ſuch as are ſluggiſh, to comfort ſuch as are carefull
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:7222:178"/> and zealous, and to diſcountenance ſuch as are open or ſecret enemies. But how many are there that would be called and accounted faithfull ſhepherds and true Teachers ſent of God, who are affraid their hearers ſhould bee too forward: like enuious Maiſters, that are loath to haue good Schollers, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at it to haue any profit too much vnder them. Thus they nuzzle them in ignorance that are blinde, they ſtrengthen the hand of iniquity, they encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage euill doers, and diſcourage thoſe that would faine walke in the wayes of godlineſſe. It was the earneſt deſire of <hi>Moſes,</hi>

Hee ſpeaketh it before <hi>Labans</hi> face, and doth not whiſper it behinde his backe, hee auouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it before him, that he might take exception to it, if he had ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect againſt it, <note n="q" place="margin">Gen. 31, 39, 40.</note> 
                  <hi>Whatſoeuer was torne of Beaſts, I brought it not vnto thee, but made it good my ſelfe: of mine hand didſt thou require it, were it ſtolne by day, or ſtollen by night, I was in the day conſumed with heate, and with froſt in the Night, and my ſleepe departed from mine eyes.</hi> This duty and diligence did he perform, and yet what was the wages of the woorke, and the recompence of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors?

               <p>The examples of the Iſraelites is fit to be thought vpon, and worthy to be conſidered in this caſe, when they ſoiourned and ſerued in the land of <hi>Egipt,</hi> according as the Lord fore-ſhewed vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi>

Let vs therefore by all theſe examples be encouraged, and know that nothing can happen vnto vs, which hath not fallen out to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that haue liued before vs, who haue done as good and faithful ſeruice to their ſuperiors, as we haue done or can do, and yet haue beene euilly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, and wrongfully purſued, and cruelly handled, and vniuſtly rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

This point, is in theſe words declared by the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, or by a word of Relation, a beloued Brother, which was more then a ſimple ſeruant. For if he had any vnbeleeuers (that were not of the houſhold of Faith) either borne in his houſe, or bought with his money, they were his ſeruants, but they were not beloued Brethren. But this man conuerted to the Faith was aboue the ranke and degree of ſuch perſons, hee was both a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant and a Brother. True it is, there was great difference betweene <hi>Philemon</hi> and <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> betweene the Maiſter and Seruant in things of this life; one, was Superior; the other, Inferior: one was to command, the other to obey; one was to rule, the other to be ſubiect in the Lord; yet wee ſee, how the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in this place is not affraide to call <hi>Oneſimus</hi> his Maiſters Brother, and would not haue the Maiſter aſhamed to acknowledge it in words, &amp; to ſhew it in his practiſe. This is not ſpoken, as if they were naturall Bretheren in the fleſh, and deſcended of one Father, according to the common generation of the reſt of the ſonnes of men; but they were Brethren in Chriſt, partakers of the common Faith, equall in the participation of heauenly graces, alike in the fauour of God, one not dearer to him then another. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle before Verſe 7. and afterward, verſe 20. calleth <hi>Philemon</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Chriſt, though he were his ſonne in the Goſpell, becauſe hee had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten him vnto God by the immortall ſeede of the word, <note n="u" place="margin">Verſe 19.</note> as wee ſhall ſee in the words following, where he challengeth as his own, and as a due debt vnto him, whatſoeuer <hi>Philemon</hi> had.</p>

How meane ſoeuer our places, how ſimple ſoeuer our perſons, how baſe ſoeuer our conditions are, we haue as good a title, and as great an intereſt in the death and paſſion of Chriſt, as they that ſhine in the world, that are clad in Purple, and fare deliciouſly euery day. And as theſe haue redemption by him, ſo God affordeth to them the meanes of ſaluation, as wel as the mightieſt Monarkes vpon the earth. The poore man hath the word of God offered to him, reade vnto him, and preached vnto him as well as the rich: he hath the Sacraments of God prouided for him, as well as for them that are of high place: he may pray vnto God as freely, as comfortably, as chearefully, as the great men of the earth, and he hath a gracious promiſe to be heard and reſpected, as well as they.

So then, ſeeing God accepteth no mans perſon, ſeeing Chriſt vouchſafeth to call vs Bretheren; and laſtly, ſeeing the faithfull haue redemption by his bloode, it followeth neceſſarilie, that our Chriſtian Religion, and Faith in Chriſt, doe make all perſons after a ſort e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, as Bretheren and Siſters of one and the ſame Father and Family, and Ioynt-heyres of one and the ſame Kingdome, that is immortall and neuer fadeth.</p>

Yet theſe poore contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible ones are deare in his ſight, tender as the Apple of his eye, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged of him to be his Bretheren. Wee are not worthy therefore to bee eſteemed of Chriſt, if we regard not ſuch as are in greateſt price, and chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt account with him.</p>
               <p>So then, we muſt take heede, that wee neuer deſpiſe, and deride, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain thoſe that are called the Brethren of Chriſt, nor refuſe to imbrace them as our owne Brethren. This is that vſe which the Apoſtle vrgeth, in ſetting downe the duties of Maiſters, <note n="u" place="margin">Epheſ. 6, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye Maiſters, do the ſame thinges vnto them, putting away threatning, and know, that euen your Maiſter alſo is in heauen, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there respest of perſons with him.</hi> Where we ſee, how hee moueth all Maiſters to caſt off all pride and high conceite of themſelues, and to Loue their faithfull ſeruants, as their faithfull Bretheren. It is not farre from this purpoſe, which <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaketh touching his practiſe and behauiour toward his Seruants, <note n="x" place="margin">Iob. 31, 13, 14, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>If I did contemne the iudgement of my ſeruant and of my Mayde, when they did contend with me, What then ſhall I do when God ſtandeth vp? And when he ſhall viſit me, What ſhall I anſwere? He that hath made me in the womb, hath he not made him? Hath not he alone faſhioned vs in the womb?</hi> Where the holy man commendeth mildneſſe in all Gouernors, and reprooueth the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of cruelty toward their ſeruants. Hee gaue them free libertie to declare and debate the matter with him, to alledge what reaſonable excuſe ſoeuer they had, conſidering with himſelfe, that we haue one common Creator and maker, and are partakers of the ſame Nature, and concluding thereuppon, that albeit ſuch as are bound to ſerue vs, bee of low degree, and deſpiſed in the world, yet they neuertheleſſe are our brethren. So then, ſuch as are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced vnto high places, and ſet in authority ouer others, are not to trample them vnder their feete, to deſpiſe and ſet them at naught, to account them as vile perſons in their eies, but to vſe them with mildneſſe, and to behaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in al lowlines, &amp; to rule their houſes with al gentleneſſe. We muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that wee haue a Maiſter in heauen, ſo that albeit he hath exalted vs on high, yet God ſtandeth aboue all, and is the Maiſter both of the Maiſter, &amp; of the ſeruant. O that this were well waighed, and wiſely conſidered, and thoroughly learned of all Superiors, that ſit at the ſterne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and guide the ſhip. The higher and greater our places are, the lower and leſſer ought our hearts
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:7222:181"/> to be. If we be made Magiſtrates and Maiſters, and Rulers, to gouern others, let vs confeſſe they be Brethren with vs. This yeeldeth a profitable medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all Chriſtian Gouernors, when we behold any of our Inferiors (thogh they were our bondmen) in any trouble or diſtreſſe, to thinke earneſtly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe things. If God haue made mee neuer ſo high, when I ſee the people pinched with dearth and famine, that they are ready to periſh and famiſh in the ſtreats for want of Bread, I muſt knowe they are not Dogges, (though many make no better nor farther reckoning of them) alas, alas, they are my Brethren.</p>
               <p>When the Peſtilence walketh in the darkeneſſe, and the plague deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at noone day, that God ſtriketh downe with his fearfull hand; that thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands fall at our ſide, and ten thouſands at our right hand (for he oftentimes maketh hauocke, and bringeth deſolation into many houſes and families) I muſt thinke it is no Murraine of Cattle, they are my bretheren. When I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the oppreſſion of the poore, and the grinding of the faces of the needy, that they are eaten vp as bread, and ſold as old ſhooes, for nothing; I muſt haue this feeling of their affliction, they are not as Horſſes or Aſſes ouer-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with their burthen (whom yet, if it were ſo, <note n="y" place="margin">Exo. 23, 4, 5.</note> we were bound to pity &amp; raiſe vp, though belonging to our enemy) they are my poore and dear bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, whom God hath created, whom Chriſt hath redeemed, whom the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit hath ſanctified, whom the word hath regenerated, whom the church hath nouriſhed, whom the Angelles haue guarded, and who, together with me, in the laſt day, ſhall be glorified. At that day ſhal God be all in al, when Chriſt Ieſus ſhall aboliſh all power and authority among men, when Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces muſt reſigne their kingdomes, and caſt downe their crownes at his feete, then there ſhall be no more Prince and Subiects, Paſtor and people, Mayſter and Seruant, Father and Sonne, Husband and Wife. Theſe degrees indure but for a ſeaſon, which muſt haue end, when Chriſt ſhall come to iudge the quicke and the dead. If God haue made me a Maiſter, and committed Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to my charge, they muſt not be reſpected as my Swine or Oxen; they are my Brethren, and therefore I muſt looke vnto them in time of their ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp; vſe all good meanes for their deliuerance. The Centurion in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is commended, that when his ſeruant fell ſick, &amp; was in danger of death, he came to Chriſt <note n="z" place="margin">Math. 8, 6.</note> for help and ſuccour. If a man haue a Bullocke and beaſt that is diſeaſed, he will aske counſel, &amp; ſeeke remedy, much more ought we to deale mercifully with our ſeruants which God hath made our brethren, &amp; not to ſhew more mercy to our Cattle for our commodity ſake, then to man made after the Image of God for his ſake. To conclude, let vs from this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian equality, learne Chriſtian mercy, and know the eſtate of them that ſuffer any kind of miſery. For what is the cauſe that we tyranize ouer thoſe that are our Inferiors, but becauſe we forget that we are their bretheren, and that in this reſpect they are equall vnto vs?</p>

For ſeeing God hath thus farre prouided for them to call them their Bretheren, and to make them equall with thoſe of greater Callinges, they are to bee contented with their places. It is a great Honour, to be ſo greatly in his fauour, and to bee ſo highly regarded of him, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth no man for his poore degree, for his low eſtate; for his meane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. This is it which the Apoſtle Paule ſetteth downe, 1. Cor. 7, 21, 22. <hi>Art thou called being a Seruant? Care not for it: but if yet thou maiſt be free, vſe it rather: for he that is called in the Lord, being a Seruant, is the Lords free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: Likewiſe alſo, be that is called beeing free, is Chriſts Seruant.</hi> Where he
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:7222:182"/> ſheweth, that no mans poore calling ſhould be his diſcouragement: but this muſt be his comfort, and bring peace vnto his ſoule, that if hee be a true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer, although he be mans ſeruant, yet he is Gods free man. And whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the ſonne <note n="b" place="margin">Iohn 8, 34, 36.</note> maketh free, he is free indeede. For, wee muſt know, that whoſoeuer committeth ſinne with greedineſſe, and draweth iniquitie as with Cart-ropes, he is the ſeruant of ſinne, though he were the Maiſter of a family, or the Ruler of a kingdome. And on the other ſide, whoſoeuer is freed from the bondage of ſinne, and the ſlauery of the Deuill, he is a right free-man, although he be a Captiue, a Priſoner, or a Seruant. If wee haue our part in Chriſt, we haue our part in this comfort, ſeeing the Seruant is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as well as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, we muſt conſider theſe two thinges, both that whatſoeuer our calling be, wherein we abide, whether it bee high or low, wee haue it from God, we are alotted vnto it by his appointment, and that hee ſeeth it, and knoweth it to be the fitteſt place and beſt calling for vs vnder the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens. For, he reſpecteth in all his purpoſes, his owne glory, and our profite. If he ſaw any condition of life to be better for vs, or a meanes to further vs in our holy faith and ſaluation, he would not keepe vs from it, he would not deny it vnto vs, he would not reſtraine vs of it. It is a ſpice of the Deuils poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which he inſpired &amp; inſtilled into the minds of our firſt parents, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue hardly of Gods dealing toward vs, as if of malice or enuy he had helde vs from the greater good, and beſtowed vpon vs the leſſer. He came to them in the Garden, and told them, <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 3, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>That God doth know, that when they ſhould eate of the tree of knowledge of good &amp; euill, in the middeſt of the Paradice of God, their eyes ſhould be opened, and they ſhould be as Gods knowing good and euill.</hi> So when we grow diſcontented, and diſlike our callings which God hath appointed vnto vs, we begin to be inueigled by the ſubtilty of Satan, and ſhalbe alwaies aſpiring higher, then God hath iudged to be meet for vs. Let this ſerue vs, &amp; ſuffice vnto vs, that how lowe ſoeuer in our owne eyes, and little in the eyes of others, our condition is, yet God hath made them equall with vs, and vs Brethren with them, to our great and endleſſe comfort. This is that vſe which the Apoſtle maketh to encourage and ſtrengthen ſeruants in their duties, <note n="d" place="margin">Epheſ. 6, 5, 6 7, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Seruants, be obedient vnto them that are your Maiſters, according to the fleſh with feare and trembling, in ſingleneſſe of your hearts, as vnto Chriſt.

Hee liketh and alloweth that which is done of the ſeruant, as well as that which proceedeth from the Maiſter: and he that is of low degree, pleaſeth God in the duties of his calling, as well as the man that is of greateſt reputation in the world, and highly magnified for his Riches and Honors.</p>

There is no difference with God, there is no inequality with Chriſt, to them that are in Chriſt, high and low are all alike with him. None are ſaued for their highneſſe, none are condemned for their lowneſſe. Chriſt Ieſus accepteth no man for his glory, he reiecteth no man for his ignominy. Let vs therefore not beare our ſelues bold and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent vpon our outward excellency, but ſtand in feare of his iudgements, and prepare our ſelues with all reuerence and diligence, that we may bee found

Then ſhall all fleſh be gathered together from the foure windes, and ſtand before the Iudge of all the world.

Then muſt euery man anſwere for himſelfe, and plead guilty or not guiltie, when no pretenſes, or excuſes, or delayes ſhal auaile vs. Then ſhal the poore begger appeare without his rags; the rich Glutton without his Robes; Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous <hi>Indas</hi> without his bagges; Crafty <hi>Gehazi</hi> without his money; Proud <hi>Haman</hi> without his Honor; Aſpyring <hi>Abſolon</hi> without his Ambition; Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering <hi>Caine</hi> without his Weapon; Cunning <hi>Achitophell</hi> without his Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.

Thus it fareth with euery one of vs; to one, we owe one Talent; to another, three Tallents; to another, fiue Tallents; but to God we are aboue all others moſt deepely indebted; we owe vnto him, our goods, our good Names, our ſubſtance, our libertie, our liues, our ſelues, our ſoules, our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and when wee haue giuen him all, all will not ſerue to pay him, ſeeing we owe vnto him more then we haue.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that our Sauiour ſaith; <note n="p" place="margin">Math. 22, 37 38, 39.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy Soule, and with all thy minde: this is the first and the great Commaundement: and the ſecond like vnto this; Thou ſhalt loue thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelfe.</hi> We ſee then the order of the Commaundements ſet downe by the God of order, that God hath the firſt place, and man the ſecond; the duties we owe vnto him, are preferred before the duties we owe to our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. And if we marke the Lords prayer, and the order which we are taught to obſerue in our Prayers and Petitions, we ſhall finde thoſe ranged in the firſt place that touch the honour of his Name, before ſuch as belong to our neceſſities: ſo that the duties are greater, the Chaines are ſtronger, the bands are faſter, and the reaſons are firmer to binde vs, and knit vs vnto God. In him <note n="q" place="margin">Acts 17, 28. and 14, 17.</note> we liue and mooue, and haue our being. He ſendeth Raine and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeaſons, he filleth our hearts with ioy and gladneſſe. He made vs, and not we our ſelues, he made vs of nothing, and when we became deformed, hee reformed vs. He hath written his Lawes in our hearts, and our ſinnes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities he will remember no more. What wrong and iniury hath the Lord done vs, that hauing receiued ſo many pledges of his fauour, and ſealed ſo many bands, acknowledging the infinite debts that ws owe vnto him, wee ſhould preferre Duſt and Aſhes before him, and ſet vp proud fleſh in diſgrace and deſpite of him? We ſee what mightie and waightie reaſons wee haue to magnify him aboue all Creatures in Heauen and Earth, and to aduance him aboue all excellency that is in man, whoſe breath is in his Noſthrils: and yet who is it that giueth him his due, and doth not extoll the Creature aboue the Creator, who is bleſſed for euer?</p>
               <p>True it is, euery man will pretend loue to God, as to him that hath elected him, created him, redeemed him, called him, adopted him, iuſtified him, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified him, and preſerued him. But doe we loue his word aboue our owne paſtimes and pleaſures? Our Sauiour ſaith; <note n="r" place="margin">Iohn 14, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>If any Man loue mee, hee will keepe my word, and my Father will loue him, and we will come and dwell with him: he that loueth not me, keepeth not my word.</hi> If then we preferre the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of our owne vanities before the hearing of his truth, we plainely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray the hypocriſie of our hearts, and ſhew that our loue is faſtned vpon the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:7222:184"/> Earth. We will all ſeeme to loue the Lord, and his word, leaſt all men ſhould condemne vs, and cry ſhame of vs: but this our loue continueth no longer, then till ſome profit or pleaſure round vs in the eare, and come in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (as it were) to be waighed in the ballance together; then farewell God, and his Word, and his Sabbaoths, we will none of them, ſo long as we haue the other to follow after. What is more common in continuall practiſe then this? Will not a drunken Feaſt, a ryotous company of prophane Fellowes, ſooner draw vs to their Lure, then a conſcience of our duty to God to keepe vs at home, to attend to his ordinances for the ſaluation of our Soules? Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man almoſt can ſay the Commandements, and pronounce the words, but they conſider not the meaning of them, and how large they are.

Let vs now conſider with our ſelues, how deeply we are indebted vnto God, and remember that we owe many duties vnto him: he hath giuen vs much, ſo that he may require much of vs again; he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed many bleſſings vpon vs, and therefore he looketh for the greater ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice at our hands.</p>

               <p>So ſtandeth the caſe with all ſuch as open their handes to thoſe that are farre off from them, and turne away their eies from ſuch as are their fleſh, and bone, and blood, to whom God and Nature hath made them more indebted, then to other men. It was not ſo with <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Gene. 47, 12.</note> when he liued in wealth, and <hi>Iacob</hi> was in want: he was ſtored with plentie, and his Father taſted of ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, he gaue him Corne freely, and ſuſtained his Kindred willingly. The like care we ſee in <hi>Ruth</hi> toward <hi>Naomi,</hi> the Daughter in Law toward the Mother in Law, ſhe laboured and trauailed for them both, <note n="z" place="margin">Ruth. 2, 6, 14 18.</note> ſhe gleaned and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after the Reapers among the ſheaues, and what ſhe left when ſhe was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed, ſhe reſerued it, and brought all home to releeue and refreſh her olde Mother. Theſe examples are agreeable to the rule, and theſe practiſes are aunſwerable to the prccept of the Apoſtle, requiring of Children and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes to recompence the kindneſſe of their Parents. When Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour was vpon the Croſſe, he ſhewed his godlineſſe toward his Mother, and committed her to the Diſciple whom he loued, himſelfe being ready to leaue the World. For when <note n="a" place="margin">Iohn 19, 26, 27.</note> he ſaw his Mother and <hi>Iohn</hi> ſtanding by her, hee ſaid vnto his Mother; <hi>Woman, behold thy Sonne:</hi> then ſaid he to the Diſciple, <hi>Behold thy Mother, and from that houre the Diſciple tooke her home vnto him.</hi> It is the dutie of Children to honour their Parents, not onely by obedience, but by maintenance; not onely by reuerence, but by recompence; not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ſubiection, but by thankfulneſſe for the benefits that they haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. If they be hungry, they muſt feede them; if poore, they muſt releeue them; if in neceſſitie, they muſt helpe them; if weake, they muſt Miniſter vnto them. For if this muſt be performed to Strangers, much more to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents? There is nothing more iuſt then this kinde of dutie, becauſe the light of Nature teacheth, to requite one good turne for another, and to doe vnto another, as thou wouldſt haue him doe to thee. Wherefore, to deny the performance of theſe duties, is vnnaturall and inhumaine: but to breake out into the contrary practiſes, is monſtrous and beaſtly. <hi>Abſalom</hi>

                  <hi>Whoſoeuer recompenceth euill for good, euill ſhall not depart from his houſe.</hi> Thus then we ſee, that ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne their Parents, and refuſe to helpe and ſuccour thoſe that GOD hath made neareſt vnto them, and ſo bound them in a greater band, doe commit the greater ſinne, and plainely declare that their hearts are voyd of naturall affection.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The third re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe.</note> Thirdly, this Doctrine reprooueth thoſe, that where moſt cauſes and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons concurre and meete together to vrge them to their dutie, do not make vſe of them, nor bind themſelues more cloſely and ſtraightly with them, nor ſhew more kindneſſe being moued by them, ſo that the greater and moe the meanes are to tie them in affection one to another, the leſſe many times their loue is. This may be made plainely to appeare vnto vs, if we conſider the particular practiſe of the people toward their Miniſter, and the generall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour of one of the faithfull toward another. God hath bound the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to their owne Paſtor, by a ſtraighter and neerer coniunction, then to the Shepheards of other Foldes, becauſe they haue a greater charge of their Soules, and muſt giue an account for them to the cheefe Shepheard of the Sheep: and yet we ſee they are moſt bitter and violent againſt them, becauſe they reprooue their ſinnes, and diſcouer their corruptions, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues may ſee them and forſake them, and God may forgiue them. Shall the ſicke perſon hate the Phiſition becauſe hee ſheweth him his diſeaſe, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth his help &amp; beſt endeuour to cure it? In like manner, ſhall we be ſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully intreated and cruellie handled, and mortally maligned, that wiſh them the greateſt good, ſhew our ſelues their beſt friends, deale faithfull with their Soules, and labour to bring them to eternall happineſſe? This is it which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh to the <hi>Galathians;</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Gal. 4, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Am I therefore become your Enemy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I tellyou the truth?</hi> Thus alſo the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> complaineth, <note n="f" place="margin">Ier. 18, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Shall euill be recompenſed for good?

               <p>Secondly, we are to draw from hence a generall conſideration, that as God hath called vs with an holy calling, into the boſome of the Church, ſo he hath linked the faithfull in loue one to another, and yoaked them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſweet yoake of his Goſpell: and yet how many are there that profeſſe the name of Chriſt, and will needes be accounted true Chriſtians, that cannot abide the Children of God, but hate them with an vnfained ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and account them as their Mortall enemies? If we ſhould ſee a man rage againſt the members of his owne bodie, <note n="g" place="margin">Marke 5, 5.</note> and ſtrike himſelfe with ſtones to the wounding of the fleſh like the man poſſeſſed, would we not ſeek to binde him with Chaines, and ſay he were mad and out of his wits? So likewiſe, if we be in Chriſt, we haue him as our head, and are members one of another; and therefore ſuch as nouriſh the paſſions of hatred as Coales of fire kindled in their breaſtes, are out of their right minde, as men diſtracted and beſide themſelues. No man euer yet hated his owne fleſh, but nouriſheth <note n="h" place="margin">Ephe. 5, 29.</note> and cheriſheth it, euen as the Lord doth the Church. We haue many effectuall meanes and ſtrong reaſons to ioyne our affections one to another, <note n="i" place="margin">Ephe. 4, 4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>There is one Body, and one Spirit; there is one hope, and one inheritance; there is one Faith, and one Baptiſme; there is one God and Father of all, which is aboue all, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough all, and in vs all:</hi> Theſe are ſo many bands to hold vs together; if wee plucke theſe Chaines aſunder, and breake the Fetters in peeces, that no man can tame vs nor binde vs, we are not liuing but dead members, and offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:7222:185"/> to our owne fleſh. The ſingle knot of nature ought to be ſufficient to knit vs one to another, and the leaſt thred of naturall coniunction of our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, ought to ſew vs together as a Garment fitted for our bodie: how much more when many occaſions meet together, which ſhould eſtabliſh brotherly loue to continue among vs?</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 3</note> Thirdly, ſeeing coupling of many reaſons together, and the meeting of many good reſpects in one, giueth the more cauſe of ioy and gladneſſe, of louing and caring one for another, it giueth a profitable inſtruction to all Children and Seruants, and other inferiors to performe the duties of honor and reuerence to their Fathers and Maiſters. If there were no other means, this were a ſufficient meanes to make them tractable and attentiue to the wordes and directions of their Fathers and Maiſters, euen becauſe they are their Fathers and Maiſters. For this includeth many reaſons, and ioyneth them in neerer bandes, then they were tyed together before, and detecteth them of a greater ſin, and maketh them guilty of a greater iudgement. When it pleaſed God to open the mouth of <hi>Baalams</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Num. 22, 28.</note> Aſſe, to reprooue the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe and wickedneſſe of that falſe Prophet, it was his fault not to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, nor giue heede to that which is ſpoken vnto him. When God inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth vs by the Creatures which are the common Maiſters of all mankind, we muſt learne the inuiſible thinges of God by them. When the Wiſe-man <hi>paſſed by the fielde of the ſlothfull,</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Prou. 24, 30, 31, 32.</note> 
                  <hi>and by the Vine-yard of the Man deſtitute of vnderstanding, which was growne all ouer with Thornes and Nettles: he behelde and conſidered it well, he looked vpon it and receiued inſtruction.</hi> But when the Lord chuſeth one to ſpeake vnto vs, and to informe vs in his waies which hath beene the Inſtrument of our life and being, of our peace and welfare, of our good and ſaluation; we ought to haue more reſpect to his perſon, and to his perſwaſion, as he is a more honorable Meſſenger, and as his words do proceede from greater loue and kindneſſe toward vs. This ſerueth greatlie to reprooue all rebellious Children and contemptuous Seruants, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and diſtaſt the holie inſtructions and informations of their Fathers and Maiſters. If they receiue any temporall commoditie from them, this doth relliſh well in their mouthes, but they regard not their counſels, they will none of their inſtructions. Theſe are wicked Children; theſe are vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Seruants. An euill Child, is but halfe a Child; an euill Wife, is but halfe a Wife; an euill Seruant, is but halfe a Seruant; an euill Subiect, is but halfe a Subiect. The godly and gratious Child, is a Childe indeede; a godly and gratious Wife, is a true Wife indeede; a godly and gratious Seruant, is a right Seruant indeede; a godly and gratious Subiect, is to be accounted and acknowledged a true Subiect indeede. For as there are degrees of coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of mankinde one to another, which are are as certaine ſteppes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we climbe vp to the ſociety and mutuall loue of others; ſo the moe ſteps and degrees there are, the greater ought our loue to be. To be a man crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after the Image of God is one degree, and challengeth loue from vs to be performed toward him.</p>
               <p>To be ioyned in a Politicall or Domeſticall knot; to wit, in the Common wealth, or in the priuate Familie (as the Prince and Subiect, the Father and Sonne, the Maiſter and Seruant) is another, and a neerer degree, and ought to be the cauſe of farther loue. But if to theſe naturall and ciuill reſpects, there be added a ſpiritual Communion in Chriſt, which is the beſt band, that bindeth faſter then all the reſt, whereby the Subiect is made his Princes bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Child, his Fathers Brother; and the Seruant, his Maiſters Brother: this requireth a more faithfull and feruent loue, and a farther degree of our affection toward them. On the other ſide, if the coniunction betweene them be onely in the two former conſiderations, there can be no true and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere loue betweene them, albeit they bee ſo cloſely tyed together: no, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:7222:186"/> they be Fathers and Children, Husbands and Wiues, Maiſters and Seruants, Princes and Subiects. For where Chriſt Ieſus is not, there can be no ſingleneſſe and ſoundneſſe of the Soule; whoſoeuer loueth not in the Lord, he cannot loue from the heart: and where there is no true piety, there can be nothing elſe but hypocriſie, which is the bane and poiſon of true loue. Hence it is, that hee which hath an euill Seruant, doth not in truth poſſeſſe him, he hath an intereſt and propriety in the leaſt part of him: he may haue his handes, but he cannot haue his heart. So the Apoſtle ſheweth, that while <hi>Oneſimus</hi> was a wicked man, and an vnbeleeuer, his Maiſter <hi>Philemon</hi> could not commodiouſly vſe him: he wandred therefore a while from his Houſe, that by changing of the place he might be turned into another, and returne a new man; before an vnworthy Seruant, but now a profitable Seruant; nay, a beloued Brother, made neere, and after a ſort equall with his Maiſter tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Whenſoeuer therefore Kinges and Princes, Fathers and Maiſters, being beleeuers, haue vnder them, and belonging vnto them, ſuch as are vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vnbeleeuers, they cannot promiſe to themſelues that they haue the whole rule and command ouer them. This appeareth euidently in the Popiſh ſort, that beleeue the Doctrine of the Councell, or rather Conuenticle of <hi>Trent,</hi> if one that profeſſeth the Goſpell haue a Wife, or Child, or Seruant, embracing that falſly named Catholike-Religion, that reſt vpon the deceiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able errors of the Prieſts and Ieſuits, and all of them vpon the decree and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Pope; he cannot make his accounts (except he account a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe) that he hath full power ouer them, or the rule of their liues, or the loue of their hearts. We ſee it oftentimes come to paſſe in Subiects adhering to the Dregges of Popiſh ſuperſtition, that notwithſtanding the bands of fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and allegiance, whereby they are obliged to their Princes, they breake out into actions of open Rebellion, and ſeeke the ſubuerſion of King, and Countrey, and Religion. If then a man would haue an abſolute and Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne commaund ouer his Inferiours, and be aſſured to haue a whole and entire Wife, that his heart may truſt in her, and her heart reſt in him: if a man would haue a dutifull Child, and a faithfull Seruant to do his will, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme ſeruice vnto him for conſcience ſake, he muſt make choiſe of ſuch as haue in them the feare of God, the Faith of Chriſt, the guifts of the Spirit, the loue of Religion, the deſire of inſtruction, and the care of ſaluation. If theſe be wanting, neuer thinke their affection can be firmely ſetled toward thee: but vpon euerie occaſion it will be eaſilie remooued from thee.

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 4</note> Laſtlie, ſeeing the encreaſe of many bands meeting together, doubleth and trebleth the care and loue one toward another, ſo that where the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt number of meanes is found, there alſo is found the ſmalleſt loue: and where the greateſt number of occaſions concurreth (as it were) on an heap, there ought to bee the ſureſt knot of friendſhip and amitie: it ſhould put all ſuperiours in minde of a neceſſary dutie, to be carefull to inſtruct thoſe that belong to their ſeuerall charges and iuriſdictions, that ſo they may tye them with a ſurer knot to themſelues, and haue the better ſeruice at their handes. For ſeeing they are neerer coupled vnto them that are vnder the reach of their authoritie, or the roofe of their houſes, then vnto the reſt of mankinde: they ought to haue a greater reſpect vnto them, and beare a dearer loue vnto them, euen vnto their bodies, how much more vnto their Soules? But wee cannot better teſtifie our loue vnto them, and ſhew our care ouer them, then by making knowne vnto them the workes of the Lord, and the waies of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.

It was the firſt and principall care of all the godly Kings that had true Religion in their owne harts, to prouide for the inſtruction of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. The Apoſtle writing to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and preſcribing the diſtinct duties of ſundry perſons, forgetteth not the Father and the Son, and as he chargeth Children <note n="m" place="margin">Ephe. 6, 2, 4</note> 
                  <hi>To obey their Parents in the Lord:</hi> ſo he commaundeth Parents, <hi>to bring them vp in the instruction and information of the Lord.</hi> Thus godly Maiſters haue vſed all diligence to bring their Seruants to haue a deſire of Religion, and a loue to the exerciſes of pietie; whereby oftentimes ſuch a good worke hath beene wrought in them, that they haue accounted their Maiſters as ſecond Fathers, and as ſpirituall Fathers, &amp; confeſſed themſelues more bound in all dutie to them, then to their naturall Parents, hauing lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that to the glory of God, and the ſaluation of their Soules by their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters inſtruction, which they could neuer vnderſtand by their Fathers educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They haue confeſſed themſelues to haue gained more by ſuch a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, then if a large portion, a rich inheritance, and great reuennewes had beene left vnto them. And indeede, this is the onely way to teach Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren dutifulneſſe, and to frame our Seruants to obedience, to plant godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in them, and to water that which is planted. The neglect of this care in vs, will make them careleſſe: and the making of no conſcience to teach them, will bring them to be vnconſcionable in their places. If we be dumb and open not our mouths to inſtruct them, we ſhall haue deafe Children, and deafe Seruants; that will ſtoppe their eares againſt all good admonition that is offered vnto them. If we be bound in a double Band, common and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, and doe performe a ſingle dutie vnto them: it will follow, that as they owe vnto vs a two-folde dutie, generall, and particular; the generall of all mankinde; the particular of Seruants, they will perform<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The order of the words.</note> HItherto we haue ſpoken of the former reaſon drawne from the Apoſtles action of ſending him backe to his Maiſter, together with the conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and confuting of the two obiections that might be made againſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of him; one touching the retaining of him with himſelfe; the other, touching the Seruants departure from his Maiſter. Now followeth the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reaſon of the ſecond ſort, taken from the perſon of <hi>Paule,</hi> and it is of his communion with <hi>Philemon,</hi> and the participation of the ſame heauenlie guifts and graces with him. This reaſon is firſt handled, and then another Obiection is preuented. The reaſon is in this 17. Verſe: the preuention is the two next following; to wit, the 18. and 19. Verſes. This reaſon heere vſed, is breefely propounded, and yet nothing is omitted which may carrie any force of Argument to perſwade and aſſwage <hi>Philemon.</hi> For he inferreth out of the former wordes wherein he hath commended <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> not ſo much to be accounted as a Seruant, as to be receiued as a Brother, that hee is worthy to be forgiuen: and withall, he inſinnuateth and ſignifieth that hee was neceſſarilie ioyned with him in theſe bandes of mutuall loue, that hee could not be ſeparated and deuided from him, whereby it muſt come to paſſe, that one of theſe will followe; eyther thou muſt loue vs both, or elſe for euer refuſe vs both. If thou hate him, thou canſt not
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:7222:187"/> loue me: or if thou loue me, thou muſt not hate hate him. This reaſon is thus framed:
<list type="syllogism">
                     <item>
                        <hi>If we haue fellowſhip together in all common bleſſings, then receiue him.</hi>

                     </item>
                  </list> The firſt propoſition of this reaſon is in the beginning of this verſe, [<hi>If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou account our things common, receiue him.</hi>] The concluſion is amplified and made manifeſt by a compariſon of the like, [<hi>Receiue him as my ſelfe.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The meaning of the words.</note> Thus much of the Method: now let vs ſee ſomewhat concerning the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the words, which are few, and not hard. When the Apoſtle ſaith [<hi>If thou account our things common</hi>] the words in the originall are; <hi>If thou haue mee a Fellow or partaker;</hi> that is, <hi>One in common with thee:</hi> whereby he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth his ſingular affection to this poore fugitiue Seruant, and maketh his cauſe and this requeſt all one, ſo that to reiect him, was as much as if he reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>Paule;</hi> and on the other ſide, to embrace and receiue him, is accounted by him, as done to himſelfe. Againe, when he craueth to haue him receiued; by receiuing, we muſt vnderſtand, not onely the entertaining of him into his ſeruice, and the taking of him home into his houſe, but therein alſo he reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth of him, to forgiue him his offences committed againſt him, and to think well of him, as of a Brother in Chriſt. Laſtly, when he addeth [<hi>As my ſelfe</hi>] he meaneth, louingly, friendly, hartily, as thou wouldſt doe me if I came vnto thee. As if he ſhould haue ſaid; ſeeing no man denieth to his companion and familiar friend, any thing that is honeſt and iuſt, it cannot ſtand with that loue and familiarity that hath euer beene betweene thee and me, to deny me this reaſonable requeſt: but we haue beene and are moſt deare and inward friends, communicating one with another all good things, ſo that I haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted thee another my ſelfe, and thou haſt accounted me another thy ſelf, and therefore I doe not doubt, but thou wilt receiue him againe into thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, as if he were another <hi>Paule,</hi> or as a member of his body.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Sundry obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations ariſing out of this Verſe.</note> This is to be marked and conſidered concerning the meaning. The words in this verſe are not many, but the obſeruations are not few that might be concluded and collected out of the ſame. Firſt of all, many may maruaile that the Apoſtle is ſo earneſt, vehement, and importunate for a Seruant, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for ſuch a Seruant. Surely, feare of hard and ſeuere dealing might haue moued <hi>Oneſimus</hi> to diſtruſt and deſpaire, and therefore he vſeth all meanes to hold him vp, to cherriſh his faith, and to further the good work begun in him, being as yet a young plant, a new conuert, as a ioynt newly reſtored, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing yet a tender conſcience: whereby he prouoketh vs and all others, to ſeek tenderly the vpholding, maintaining, confirming, and comforting ſuch as haue giuen witneſſe of their true repentance, not to quench the ſmoaking Flaxe, nor to breake the bruiſed Reed. For ſeeing we are with all mildneſſe to receiue vnto vs ſuch as are weake in the faith; woe vnto them that ſtay them that are comming forward, and lay ſtumbling blockes in their way to bring them backe, and to cauſe them to returne to their vomit with the Dog, and to the wallowing in the mire like the Sow that was waſhed. And ſeeing the ſinner is thus to be helped, which hath approued his conuerſion vnto vs, that we are to make interceſſion vnto others, to obtaine pardon for the penitent; we are admoniſhed, that they are much more fauourably handled, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be receiued, and gently to be remitted by our ſelues.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we ſee, that to the old requeſt he addeth a new reaſon: for we ſhal neuer finde in this Epiſtle, his petition barely and nakedly propounded. He
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:7222:187"/> hath vſed diuers Arguments before to perſwade <hi>Philemon,</hi> yet heere we haue another annexed, to moue him to grant it without denyall or reſiſtance. This giueth inſtruction to the Miniſters of the Goſpell, to teach the truth ſoundly and ſubſtantially, as that the conſciences of the people may be wel grounded, and throughly ſetled therein. When matters of weight and importance are in queſtion, they muſt not deale rawly, they muſt not vſe weake proofes and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient reaſons, whereby men may be rather hardned in their errors, then helped out of their errors.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtle doth not ſimply ſay; <hi>If our things be common</hi> (as hee might haue done) <hi>but if thou account them common,</hi> and vs to haue a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion betweene our ſelues: declaring thereby, that it is not enough to know a truth, vnleſſe we alſo yeeld vnto it as vnto a truth. It is one thing to know what is good, and another thing to embrace it in our practiſes. It is one thing to know what is euil, and another to refuſe it in our actions. We muſt labor not onely to haue our minds cleered, our vnderſtandings and our iudgments rectified to ſee the truth, but to haue our harts and affections ſanctified to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it. It behoueth therefore not to reſt our ſelues ſatisfied with generall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but ſo to enſue after them, as that we make ſpeciall application of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: <hi>Dauid</hi> in general knew that Adultery was euill; <hi>Noah</hi> knew that drunkenneſſe was beaſtly, <hi>Peter</hi> knew the denying of his Maiſter was fearefull; yet in the brunt of tentation, though the minde had knowledge of it, the affections would not refuſe it, but yeelded as a Cittie beſiedged by an enemy.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Apoſtle putteth <hi>Philemon</hi> in minde, that ſeeing there was ſo neere a coniunction between them twaine, that they were become as it were one man, and had one minde in two bodies; it followeth, that whatſoeuer was ioyned to one of them, ought of neceſſity to bee ioyned to the other. Whereby we ſee, that ſuch as are our friends, ought to be alſo the friends of our friends, that is; of thoſe that are ioyned vnto vs. <hi>Philemon</hi> was the friend of <hi>Paule,</hi> and therefore if <hi>Oneſimus</hi> were the friend of one, he muſt needes be the friend of the other. <hi>Paule</hi> and <hi>Philemon</hi> were as two Brethren, if then <hi>Oneſimus</hi> were the Brother of <hi>Paule,</hi> he ought alſo to be accounted the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Philemon,</hi> and therefore he would haue him receiued as himſelfe. It is no true friendſhippe when one taketh profeſſion to loue another man, and yet hateth him which is his cheefeſt and deareſt friend: for if indeede we lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him, we would for his ſake loue the other that loueth him. This we ſee in the couenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Iam. 2, 23.</note> who is called <hi>The friend of God,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeareth, <note n="o" place="margin">Gen. 12, 3.</note> that the Lord promiſed to be a friend to his friends, and an enemy to his enemies.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, in the amplification of the concluſion, he addeth [<hi>As my ſelfe</hi>] there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhewing, that he would haue him regarded no otherwiſe then himſelfe. Whereby we learne, that our loue to the Brethren ought not to be in word, or in tongue, or in ſhew, but in deed, in truth, and in hart. This is Chriſtian loue, this was in Chriſt toward vs, and this ſhould be in all of vs one toward another. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3, 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12, 9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4, 8. Theſe particular obſeruations and ſundry others might be ſtood vpon, and farther enlarged, but I haue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pointed them out, and will leaue them to your farther conſideration. I wil onely ſtand vpon the Doctrines that are more principally intended, and more particularly purpoſed, which conſiſt in the ſtrength of the reaſon, and in the truth of the words in themſelues conſidered.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">[<hi>If thou account our things common, receiue him as my ſelfe.</hi>]</q> This reaſon is drawne from the working cauſe. Where, to moue <hi>Philemon</hi> to graunt his petition, he alleadgeth the communion that was betweene them. If I bee partaker with thee, and thou with mee of the common benefites, ſo that the ſame thing which is mine is thine, and the ſame thinges which are thine, I may account mine; thou being my Friend, canſt not deny to loue
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:7222:188"/> and receiue him that is my Friend. Indeede, if we had onely a priuate reſpect vnto our ſelues, ſo that my things were mine owne, and not thine; and thy things were thine owne, and not mine, thou mighteſt deny me my requeſt: but ſeeing thou art another, my ſelfe, and deare vnto me as mine owne ſoule, it is a forcible reaſon to ſtirre thee vp, both to heare and graunt that which I deſire and requeſt of thee. <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. The conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion one with another, ought to moue vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> From hence we learne, that the conſideration of the mutuall coniunction that we haue one with another, giueth vs an intereſt one in another, and ought greatly to moue vs to heare and regard each other. So then, the acknowledgement of our communion ought to ſtirre vs vp to haue ſuch a care one of another, that nothing requeſted vpon good ground ſhould be denyed. This is it which the Father of the faithfull calleth vnto <hi>Lots</hi> remembrance; <note n="p" place="margin">Gene. 13, 8. Actes 7, 26,</note> 
                  <hi>Let not vs striue, for we are Brethren.</hi> So dealeth <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> toward the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> he ſhewed himſelfe vnto them as they ſtroue, and would haue ſet them at one againe, ſaying; <hi>Sirs, ye are Brethren, why doe yee wrong one to another?</hi> The Apoſtle telleth the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that they were as one Body, and one Spirit, they had all one Faith and Baptiſme, and hope of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note n="q" place="margin">Ephe. 4, 3, 4.</note> and thereupon perſwadeth with them to endeuour to keep the vnitie of the Spirit in the Bond of peace. Thus he teacheth the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> 
                  <note n="r" place="margin">1 Cor. 12, 13</note> 
                  <hi>By one ſpirit we are all baptized into one body, whether we be Iewes or Grecians, whether we be bond or free, and haue been all made to drinke into one ſpirit, ſo that the gifts giuen vnto vs, are giuen to profit withall.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; <hi>Hereby haue we perceiued loue, that he laid downe his life for vs, therefore we ought alſo to lay downe our liues for the Brethren.</hi> This appeareth in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Chriſt, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Iohn 11, 11.</note> he ſaid vnto his Diſciples; <hi>Our friend Lazarus ſleepeth, but I go to wake him vp.</hi> Where we ſee he maketh the friendſhip that was betweene them a motiue to go to <hi>Bathania,</hi> to raiſe him vp from the dead. This is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red alſo vnto vs in the parable propounded by Chriſt, <hi>Which of you ſhall haue</hi>

Al theſe places and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples teach vs to be ready to performe all duties of loue and kindneſſe one to another, ſeeing there is, or ought to be a common fellowſhip among vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 1.</note> The reaſons of this truth are very plaine and apparant. For firſt of all, we haue all of vs one common Father, we are al his children; we haue one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Maker, we are the worke of his hands. If then we be ſo neerely tied, ſo cloſely linked &amp; yoked one to another, we ought to haue a great care and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect one of another. This is it which <hi>Iob</hi> conſidered to moue him to mildneſſe toward his Inferiors, <note n="u" place="margin">Iob 31, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>He that hath made me in the wombe, hath he not made him? Hath not he alone faſhioned vs in the womb?</hi> Where he ſheweth, that the Maiſter and the Seruant haue one and the ſame Creator, ſo that they are ſo ſtraightly ioyned together, as that they are bound to bee beneficiall one to another. To this purpoſe <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <note n="x" place="margin">Prou. 22, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>The rich and the poore meet together, the Lord is the maker of them all;</hi> that is, they liue together in a common fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, and one ſtandeth in need of another.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 2.</note> Secondly, as we haue one common Father, ſo we haue one head, and are the members one of another. This is it which our Sauiour teacherh in the Goſpell; <note n="y" place="margin">Iohn 10, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>There ſhall be one ſheep-fold and one Shepheard.</hi> There cannot bee a neerer coniunction &amp; communion, then the members of the ſame body haue one with another: euery one ſeeketh the good of another, and all labour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the benefit and preſeruation of the whole. This compariſon is fitly alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Apoſtle, <note n="z" place="margin">1 Cor. 12, 12</note> 
                  <hi>As the body is one and hath many Members, and all the members of the body, which is one, though they be many, yet are but one body: euen ſo is Chriſt.</hi> So then, ſeeing God is the common Creator of vs all, and ſeeing we are made the members one of another, through our coniunction and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt, we gather from both theſe conſiderations, that our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

And firſt, if the communion that we haue one with another, and the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of friendſhip ought to moue vs to Chriſtian duties; then it followeth much more, that the communion that we haue with Chriſt, and the honour which God vouchſafeth vnto vs to account vs his Friendes, ſhould be auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ioyne vs to him, to teach vs to obey him, to honor him, to ſerue him, to worſhip him, and to walke in the practiſe of his Commandements. Hence it is, that <hi>Abraham</hi> performing the condicions of the Couenant that God hath required of him, when he promiſed to be his God, and the God of his Seede, <note n="a" place="margin">2 Chro. 20, 7 Eſay 41, 8.

                  <hi>Ye are my Friendes, if ye do whatſoeuer I commaund you: henceforth call I you not Seruants, for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant knoweth not what the Maiſter doth: but I haue called you Friendes, for all thinges that I heard of my Father, haue I made knowne to you.</hi> No friendſhip is more glorious and gainefull, then the frendſhip of God, none is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant or continuall, ſeeing whom he loueth, he loueth to the end.

               <p>Now the honor is great, ſo we muſt know wherein it conſiſteth: for friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is not an idle name, without the truth of the thing. The loue of God to vs is ſeene in his fauour toward vs, in bleſſing of vs, in taking the care of vs, in pardoning our ſins, in adopting of vs to be his Sons, and in giuing of vs eternall life. Our loue toward God is to be meaſured by keeping his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, in depending vpon him, in beleeuing in him, and in looking for all good things from him. But if we rebell againſt him, and forſake his lawes, we cannot make any account of Gods friendſhip, nor make our recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to haue him to be our friend. For ſin is a Make-bate. Commonly we hate and deteſt thoſe as the worſt ſort of men, that raiſe contention among Friends.

Secondly, ſuch as ſay, whatſoeuer is mine, is mine: and whatſoeuer is thine, is mine: mine owne is no way ſufficient for me, but I hope &amp; gape for a part of thine. The firſt ſort do not conueigh other mens goods to themſelues, but refraine from wrong and oppreſſion: yet they cannot abide to do good to any, nor to giue away any thing that is their owne. The ſecond ſort are yet farther remooued from true Charity, who regard not what meanes they vſe to get other mens goods. Let ſuch men <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Innocen. de vtilit. condicio. humanae.</hi>
                  </note> conſider, that they offend againſt God, they offend againſt their Neighbour, they offend againſt themſelues. Againſt God, becauſe they detaine from him his due; againſt their Neighbour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they deny to him thinges neceſſary; againſt themſelues, becauſe they with-hold thinges fit and reaſonable. They are vnthankfull to God, they are vniuſt to their Neighbour, they are cruell to themſelues. The Apoſtle char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them to commit Idolatry, and to make a God, or rather an Idoll of their money, becauſe as the Idolater ſerueth his Idoll, ſo doth the couetous man his riches, and as the one maketh his Image his hope and truſt, ſo doth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his treaſure; and as the one is afraid to breake his Image, ſo is the other afraid to leſſen his ſubſtance. Theſe are they that are content to cut large thonges of other mens goods, but are ſparing in ſpending of their owne; who empty their bellies, that they may fill their Coffers, who pinch their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that they may enlarge their gaine, and draw backe their hand when they ſhould giue, but ſtretch it forth when they would receiue. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle ſaith, <note n="e" place="margin">Col. 3, 5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Mortifie your members which are on the earth, fornication, vncleanneſſe, the inordinate affection, euill concupiſcence, and couetouſneſſe which is Idolatry, for the which thinges ſake the wrath of God commeth on the Children of diſobedience.</hi> And in another place he teacheth, <hi>that</hi>

                  <hi>the loue of money is the root of all euill, which while ſome luſted after, they erred from the faith, and pierced themſelues through with many ſorrowes.</hi> In which wordes, howſoeuer the Apoſtle vſeth an exceſſiue kind of ſpeaking (for properly originall ſinne is the root of all euils, becauſe as a fruitful off-ſpring they ariſe from thence) yet it is a Mother that bringeth forth many Children; Cruelty, Iniuſtice, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, Fraud, Deceit, Ignorance of God, contempt of his word, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in all heauenly thinges. Theſe thinges being duely conſidered, ſerue to the condemnation of thoſe that ſhut vp the bowels of compaſſion from Gods Children in their afflictions and neceſſities. For the Apoſtle Iohn in his firſt Epiſtle ſaith, <note n="g" place="margin">1 Iohn. 3, 17</note>

How can theſe men thinke to find mercy at the handes of God that ſhew no mercy to their bretheren, ſeeing there ſhall be iudgement mercileſſe, to ſuch as ſhew no mercy? Let vs haue our conuerſation without couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <hi>Let</hi>

               <p>Secondly, this reproueth ſuch as haue no familiarity with the faithful, but
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:7222:191"/> ſhew themſelues ſtrangers vnto them. For, whereas al our loue ſhould be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Saints, all our delight ſhould be in the Saintes, all our care ſhould be of the Saints; there are many that boaſt themſelues to be of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints, yet make no difference of any company; the moſt wicked are moſt welcome vnto them, and the moſt prophane, are moſt pleaſant. No company is ſo ſweete and ſo much deſired, as the Communion and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of Ruffians and ſcoffers; and on the other ſide, nothing is more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and ſharpe vnto them, then the preſence and conference of ſuch as feare God. But we muſt all knowe, that much helpe or hurt commeth to men, by the company which they haunt and frequent. Hence it is, that the Prophet ſaith, <note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 119, 116</note> 
                  <hi>Away from me ye wicked, for I will keepe the Commandements of my God.</hi> So the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> admoniſheth al thoſe that would be deliuered from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, <note n="m" place="margin">Acts 2, 40.</note> 
                  <hi>To ſaue themſelues from a froward generation.</hi> Likewiſe <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron</hi> exhorting the people to beware of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> and the Rebellious rowt of their adherents, ſaith, <note n="n" place="margin">Numb. 16, 21, 24, 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Seperate your ſelues from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong this Congregation, depart from the Tents of theſe wicked men, and touch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of theirs, leaſt ye periſh in all their ſinnes.</hi> The vngodly haue their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane meetings, their drunken feaſts, their vnlawfull paſtimes; let vs not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with them in their euill, which is the right way, and the ready means to quench all holy deſires, and good purpoſes in vs, as faſt as the friendſhip of the faithfull is able to kindle them in our hearts. When ſhall wee ſee wicked men ſtriue and contend to come into the Company of the godly? They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count nothing ſo vnſauoury vnto them, nothing ſo irkeſome, nothing ſo troubleſome, albeit they might bee helped and benefited by their bleſſed meetings. How is it then, that we ſhould deſire or affect the conuerſation of the vngodly, by whom we can no way bee furthered in any good thing, but be corrupted and defiled in our wayes, to the diſhonour of God, to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of our ſoules, and to the peruerting and poyſoning of others.</p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 3</note> Laſtly, ſeeing there is a Communion and fellowſhip of all the bleſsinges of God beſtowed vpon vs, it is our dutie to loue one another, &amp; to performe al duties of loue, to the benefit of others, as if we were one man. This the Prophet teacheth, <note n="o" place="margin">Ier. 32, 38, 39</note> 
                  <hi>They ſhall be my people, and I will bee their God, and I will giue them one heart, and one way, that they may feare me for euer, for the wealth of them, and of their Children after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> So the Apoſtle <note n="p" place="margin">1 Pet. 2, 17 &amp; 3. 8, &amp; 4, 8. &amp; 5, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> chargeth vs, to loue brotherly fellowſhip, <hi>ſaying; Be of one mind, one ſuffer with another; loue as Brethren. be pittifull, be courteous, ſubmit your ſelues one to another, render not euill for euill, neither rebuke for rebuke, but contrariwiſe, bleſſe; knowing that yee are thereunto called, that ye ſhould be heires of bleſſing.</hi> Whereby it appeareth, that there are many duties, as it were branches of this loue, as wee ſee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12, 9, 10, 13. where many particulars of this vnfaigned and feruent loue are expreſſed, and we are admoniſhed as members of one body, to prouide one for another. We are bound to employ our gifts, not only to our own bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, but to the benefit of the whole body: as the eye ſeeth not for it ſelf alone. the hand worketh for all the parts, the foot walketh for euery member. So if we be true and faithfull Chriſtians, we ought to carry this minde, to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to do ſeruice one to another. If we haue knoledge, it is our duty to teach others; if we haue wiſedome, it is our duty to counſell and direct others; if we haue the guift of exhortation, we are to diſſwade from Vice, to perſwade to Vertue, and to ſtirre vp others to good things. If we haue riches and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bleſsings, we muſt giue chearefully, not onely of our ſuperfluity, but of our penury and neceſsity, if neede ſo require. We haue al receiued ſom gifts, none is an empty veſſell without liquor, or a dead tree without fruite; God, to make men without excuſe, hath beſtowed ſomewhat vpon all, <note n="q" place="margin">Math. 25. 1 Pet. 4, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Some haue receiued fiue Talents, ſome two Talents, and ſome one Talent.</hi> Let euery man as he hath receiued the guift, miniſter the ſame one to another, as good diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:7222:192"/> of the manifold grace of God. We are ioyned together in a ſpirituall ſociety, and haue great neede one of another; as the hand cannot ſay to the foot, I haue no neede of thee; ſo no man can ſay to any of his Bretheren, I haue no neede of you. The rich cannot liue without the poore, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, the poore cannot continue without the rich. As it is the duty of ſuch as are poore to labour in their callings, it is the dutie of the rich to releeue them, not to deſpiſe them; to comfort them, not to contemne them; to help them, not to diſgrace them. Theſe practiſes of loue are a Chriſtian mans badge, declaring euidently what Maiſter he ſerueth, &amp; to whom he belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. We muſt ſhew our ſelues ready to ride and runne, to vſe our Friends and purſſe for the good of others. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle commendeth in the Church of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> not onely their loue, <note n="r" place="margin">1 Theſſ. 1, 3.</note> but their labour of loue performed with all carefulneſſe and cheerefulneſſe. Our loue therefore muſt not be idle, but diligent; not ſtanding in word, but in worke; not in profeſſion, but in action.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, we muſt by all good meanes procure the good one of another, and beare the reproofe of a friend that ſeeketh to ſet our ſinnes before vs, and to bring vs into the right way. This is it which the Apoſtle ſignifieth to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> 
                  <note n="ſ" place="margin">Gal. 4, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Be you as I, for I am euen as you, I beſeech you Brethren, ye haue not hurt me at all.</hi> Whereby he meaneth, that albeit he was compelled to vſe ſharpe reproofes (as it were) eating Coraſiues and ſtrong Purgations, that thereby he might ſtirre them vppe to repentance, and ſhew them from whence they were fallen, yet his minde was not changed toward them, nor his loue turned into hatred, as if he ſhould ſay; Think not that my conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of your errors, and reprouing of your back-ſliding from the ſincerity of the Goſpel, proceedeth from any mallice toward you, for I am the ſame man I was, and therefore looke that your minds be not eſtrange from me, for I doe tender you, euen as mine owne ſelfe. Seeing therefore a mans friend is all one with himſelfe, one is bound to ſeeke the good of another, and to beare the reproofes of things amiſſe with all patience.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, let our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion worke in vs a liuely feeling, as well of the proſperous eſtate, as of the hard condition of our Brethren; eyther to reioyce with them, or to lament with them, as occaſion is offered. This is the exhortation of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> Chapt. 12. when he hath ſtirred them vp to loue without diſſimulation; to ſeruice, without ſlothfulneſſe; to humility, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſdaine; to patience, without reuenge; to bleſſe, without curſſing; to diſtribute, without grudging; to pray, without fainting; he ſaith, <note n="t" place="margin">Ro. 12, 15, 16</note> 
                  <hi>Reioyce with them that reioyce, and weepe with them that weepe: be of like affection one toward another.</hi> This teacheth vs, that all the godly ought to haue (as it were) the ſame will and wiſh: <note n="u" place="margin">Phil. 3, 16.</note> they ought to thinke the ſame thinges, to ſpeake the ſame thinges, to further the ſame thinges one in another. The profits and diſprofits of our Bretheren, we muſt haue in common with them, and it is our duty to account them our owne. We are to mourne for the one, and reioyce for the other, as if it were our owne eſtate. When any good is befallen vnto them, we are to be glad, and to be merry at the heart, as it had befallen vs; and ſo much the rather, ſeeing we haue our portion in it. If we ſee them weakned in their eſtate, and go backward and not forward in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the World, it ought to be our greefe and ſorrow: eſpecially if we ſee them decline in the beſt things, and turne aſide out of the way from him that called them in the grace of Chriſt, wauering and wandering wide from the truth of the Goſpell which once they embraced, we ought ſo to take it to hart, &amp; to be ſwallowed vp with heauines, as if we our ſelues had gone back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. This affection is worthy great praiſe, where it is to be found. It aſſureth vs that we are liuing and feeling members in the body of Chriſt, and haue a neere coniunction with the other parts. It greatly pleaſeth God, and hath
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:7222:192"/> an aſſured promiſe of a rich reward, according to the ſaying of our Sauiour, <note n="x" place="margin">Math. 5, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed are the mercifull: for they ſhall obtaine mercy.</hi> This ſerueth to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the common practiſe of common Chriſtians, that liue as thoſe that know not, or regard not this Communion and enterchange of the ſame bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that they haue receiued at the handes of God. Theſe are they that ſay, God for vs all and euery man for himſelfe. Theſe are they that make what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit they can of others, but wil depart from nothing themſelues: who prize men as ſheep and Oxen, and bethinke with themſelues how much they may make of them, as if they brought them openly into the Market and ſet them to ſale for what will you giue me? Theſe are they that neuer eſteeme, nor make any account of their brethren, but when they haue occaſion to vſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſtand in great need and neceſſity of them. Theſe are they, that ſeeke themſelues onely and their owne good; as for others, they regard them, ſo long, and ſo farre, as they may get and gaine anything by them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common practiſe of the world deciphered and deſcribed by the Apoſtle, <note n="y" place="margin">Phil. 2, 21.</note> 
                  <hi>All ſeeke their owne, and not that which is Ieſus Chriſtes.</hi> Is it thus in the partes and members of the naturall body? Doth the eye ſee onely for it ſelfe? Doth it not giue direction to hand and foot, and ſerue to the good of the whole body? Doth the hand labour onely for it ſelfe and to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it ſelfe, or doth it not rather worke both for it ſelfe, &amp; for euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the body beſides? The foot, doth it not likewiſe walke vp and down, and take paines for the generall good and common benefite euen of the leaſt part that belongeth to the body? If it be thus in the ſeuerall members of our body, ought it not much rather to be ſo in the miſticall body of Chriſt Ieſus? Shall we then make a Mart or Monopoly of our bretheren, and fell them for our owne filthy gaine and priuate aduantage? But whereas we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce at their good, how many are there that repine at it, and pine away at the ſight of it? And whereas we ought to be greatly greeued to ſee them goe backe in goodes, or in goodneſſe; in the world, or in the word; they are glad to behold their wantes, and are ready to puſh them downe that beginne to fall. Theſe men are not onely without piety, but without humanity: not onely void of conſcience, but of common Ciuillity, and are no better then rotten members. Euery one would be taken and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den for a true member of Chriſt Ieſus, but few regard to do the duties of members. The partes of our bodies delight and reioyce one in another, but many of vs that dwell neere together, regard not to ſee one another in the face, or to conuerſe and communicate either with other, and yet they would be accounted Chriſtians. The partes of our body are ready to helpe and defend one another, <note n="z" place="margin">Iob. 2, 4.</note> the hand is at hand to be lifted vp to ſaue the head; to endanger one member to ſhield another, otherwiſe it were no hand: we will not hazard the leaſt trifle, for the greateſt good of others, and yet wee would be accounted Chriſtians. The partes of our body, <note n="a" place="margin">1. Cor. 12, 26</note> when one is in paine, will not leaue it deſtitute and diſtreſſed, but ſeeke by all meanes to free it out of trouble; but we are hand-faſt in helping the poore and needy members of the ſame body with vs; nay, ſuch pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes as are impoſed by Lawe vpon vs, are hardlie wrung from vs; otherwiſe we could be content to ſuffer the poore Seruantes of God to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and yet wee would be accounted Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>If God loue <note n="b" place="margin">2. Cor. 9, 7.</note> the cheerefull giuer, how ſhould he then accept of ſuch Guiftes? <hi>If we haue this worldes good,</hi>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The meaning of the wordes.</note> Thus much concerning the order of theſe two Verſes in this diuiſion: wherein we ſee, how in anſwering he argueth, and in conuincing he reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and proceedeth to defend his cauſe. Now let vs ſee the meaning of the words, ſo far as they require opening and Interpretation. Firſt, when he ſaith, [<hi>If he hath hurt thee, or owe thee ought.</hi>] Theſe generall words may be applied to any wrong, or damage, or In-iuſtice; ſignifying thereby, the Theft that <hi>Oneſimus</hi> had committed, but mitigating it by a more gentle tearme. For hereby we may gather, that he had robbed his Maiſter, as the common faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and vſual manner of thoſe is that run away. Such as are determined to go from their Maiſters, &amp; to betake themſelues to their heeles, wil not go away
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:7222:194"/> empty, but purloyne what they can: and yet the Apoſtle diminiſheth the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy of the crime, chuſing to vſe ſuch wordes as eyther betoken a ſmall fault, or containe no fault at all.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that he ſaith, [<hi>If he owe thee any thing.</hi>] For there was not any ciuill contract or bargaine betweene them, in as much as there could be no ſuch buying, or ſelling, or changing betweene the Maiſter and his Seruant, as the condition of Seruants was in thoſe times, whereof we haue ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> Wherefore we ſee that they are deceiued that think it cannot be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of this place, or from this Epiſtle, that the Seruant had robbed his Maiſter, both becauſe he is not directlie charged with theft, and becauſe the Apoſtle onely ſpeaketh by ſuppoſition, [<hi>If he haue hurt thee.</hi>] <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> I anſwere, that he doth not indeede name and expreſſe any robbing or rifling of his Maiſters Houſe; yet we muſt conſider, how he maketh the leaſt of euery thing, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his repentance which had wiped away the ſtaine thereof. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he had beene hurtfull to his Maiſter, <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it [<hi>Vnprofitable:</hi>] where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as hee had played the Runna-gate, <hi>Paule</hi> calleth it a departing away: ſo in this place, whereas he had pilferred and purloyned his Maiſters goods, <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it an hurting, which is a leſſe fault, or a debt, which is no fault. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then, throughout this Epiſtle the Apoſtles drift is, by expreſſing a little to vnderſtand more; and by naming a ſmall offence, to vnderſtand a greater; wee are not to doubt, but his meaning in theſe wordes, is to taxe him of that theft which he had committed. Neither is it any thing to the preſent purpoſe, that it is obiected, that the Apoſtle doth not plainely and directlie auouch, that he had any way hurt his Maiſter, becauſe he vttereth nothing ſimply, but by way of ſuppoſition; [<hi>If he haue hurt thee</hi>] as if hee ſpake by heare-ſay, and knew not the certainetie of that which he had heard: For no doubt he knew the whole truth of the matter by <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> who hauing truely repented, had particularly acknowledged and confeſſed the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his heart, and the vnrighteouſneſſe of his handes in defrauding of his Maiſter. <hi>He</hi> 
                  <note n="ſ" place="margin">Prou. 28, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>that hideth his ſinnes cannot prosper, but he that confeſſeth and forſaketh them, ſhall finde mercy.</hi> Whoſoeuer will obtaine pardon, muſt make confeſſion. So long as ſinne is vnacknowledged, ſo long it is vnpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. Seeing therefore he had receiued remiſsion, we cannot immagine, but that before there went confeſsion, and an vnfolding of the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the beginning to the ending; ſo that the Apoſtle would not, nor could not ſpeak waueringly and doubtfully of that, whereof he was fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, and perfectly informed from point to point. Beſides, the coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on [<hi>If</hi>] is not condicionall in this place, but Illatiue, and is not ſpoken by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, but rather by way of confeſſion or conceſſion. True it is, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is condicionallie; directlie affirming, and plainely denying nothing. As <hi>Iob</hi> 31. <note n="t" place="margin">Iob 31, 9, 13 19. Gene. 18, 24, 26, 28, 30, 31, 32.</note> 
                  <hi>If my heart hath beene deceiued by a Woman, or if I haue laid waite at the doore of my Neighbour: if I did contemne the iudgement of my Seruant: if I haue ſeene any perriſh for want of cloathing.</hi> Thus it is taken <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 24. <hi>If there be fifty righteous within the Cittie, I will ſpare all the place for their ſakes.</hi> And thus it is taken moſt commonlie throughout the Scriptures, in more then an hundred places, which are all to be vnderſtood condicionallie, not affirmatiuely.</p>
               <p>Againe, ſometimes the word is to be taken as a particle, not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uecting and concluding, but affirming, and knitting together that which is affirmed, as in many places of the 8. chapt. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 8, 17, 31.</note> 
                  <hi>If we be Children, then are we alſo heires: if God be on our ſide, who can be againſt vs:</hi> as if he ſhold ſay; ſeeing we are Children, ſeeing God is on our ſide. So the Apoſtle exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> 
                  <note n="x" place="margin">Col. 3, 1.</note> 
                  <hi>If ye then be riſen with Chriſt, ſeeke thoſe thinges that are aboue.</hi> Where he doth not ſpeake vncertainely, but conclude peremptorilie, that they ought ſeriouſly to enter into the Meditation of the heauenly life,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:7222:194"/> conſidering they had beene inſtructed in the reſurrection of Chriſt. Thus <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſpeaketh in his ſecond Epiſtle, <note n="y" place="margin">2 Pet. 2, 4 &amp; 1 Pet. 4, 17, 18</note> 
                  <hi>If God ſpared not the Angels that had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> that is; ſeeing he ſpared them not. And thus is the word taken (to go no farther) in the words immediatly going before, in this Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon,</hi> [<hi>If thou account our things common, receiue him as my ſelfe.</hi>] Where the meaning is, ſeeing all things betweene vs are common as among friends, do not thou ſtand or ſticke at the entertaining of him. So likewiſe when he ſaith, [<hi>If hee hath hurt thee</hi>] it is a granting of the crime, and as it were a confeſsing of the action whereof he might be charged, as if he had ſaid; ſeeing the caſe is ſo indeed, diſcharge him, and account me as thy debter. Thus much for the cleering of the Interpretation of the firſt words, and the anſwering of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections againſt it. It followeth [<hi>That impute to me</hi>] where he taketh the debt or wrong offered by <hi>Oneſimus</hi> vpon himſelfe, and offereth himſelfe to bee bound in a band for him, and to become his pledge or ſurety. When he ſaith [<hi>I haue written it with mine owne hand</hi>] it is the confirmation of his promiſe by a ciuill Inſtrument, and by ſubſcribing his name vnto it. Laſtly, when he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, [<hi>Albeit, I do not ſay to thee that thou oweſt to me euen thine owne ſelfe,</hi>] we muſt vnderſtand, that the debt which the apoſtle vrgeth as due vnto him from <hi>Philemon,</hi> is in reſpect of his conuerſion and winning vnto Chriſt. Wherein he alludeth to ſuch as being conquered in battell, are reſerued aliue to them that haue ouercome them, &amp; made them their Seruants, in ſauing them from death, in keeping them from the ſword, and in preſeruing them from deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Thus then the Apoſtle argueth; I being a Captaine vnder Ieſus Chriſt, to win him a people from the bondage of ſinne and Satan, haue among many other, won thee and thine whole Family, and haue taken you away as it were Captiue, deliuering you in Chriſt Ieſus from eternall miſery; and therefore thou oweſt me much more then thy Seruant can owe thee, euen thine owne ſelfe, and whatſoeuer is deareſt vnto thee: for thou haſt beene by my meanes reſcued and recouered from the bondage of Satan, &amp; the dominion of death, and haſt been brought to the freedome and liberty of the Sons of God. Thus we ſee, how the Spirit leaueth no ſtarting hole for <hi>Philemon</hi> to ſhake &amp; ſhift off this duty, to the end it might be a perpetuall rule to the Church in the like caſe, without all exception. As if the Apoſtle ſhould haue ſaid; <note n="z" place="margin" type="runSum">The ſum and ſubſtance of the words in this diuiſion.</note> If thou obiect, that thy loſſe and detriment receiued by <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> is more then thou maiſt beare and canſt forgiue: I anſwere thee, that thou ſhalt not thereby be hindered, for I thy friend <hi>Paule</hi> will anſwere thee whatſoeuer he is indebted and indangered vnto thee, euen to the vttermoſt mite thou caſt demand. And that thou ſhouldſt not doubt of mine offer; beholde, this my hand-writing ſhall be thy warrant and aſſurance, which I haue ſubſcribed with mine owne hand: albeit, I may by my right that I haue in thee (pulling thee and thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily out of the Captiuity of Satan, the ſlauery of ſin, and the bondage of hel) claime from thee more then thou canſt from <hi>Oneſimus:</hi> for thou oweſt to me indeede and in truth, not a part of thy goods and poſſeſsions, but thine owne ſelfe, euen thy Soule and Body, which are by my Miniſtry preſerued to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life: and thou canſt not ſufficiently eſteeme of thy Redemption and Saluation effected and merited by Chriſt, but manifeſted, applied, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted vnto thee by my preaching, and the graces of God beſtowed vpon me for the effectuall conuerſion of the elect.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obſeruations offered vnto vs in theſe words.</note> Thus wee haue ſeene the order of the wordes, and haue learned the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them. It remaineth according to the maner and Method before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, to gather from hence ſuch obſeruations as are intimated vnto vs, and might be largely handled of vs. Firſt of all, obſerue with me, that the Apoſtle returneth heere to a conſideration of that which might be obiected: ſo that we ſee it is the duty of the Miniſters, not onely barely to teach the truth, but to remooue doubtes, to anſwere Obiections, to put away Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:7222:195"/> and to cleere al difficulties that may ſticke in the mindes of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and hinder the beleeuing and embracing of the truth deliuered vnto them. For howſoeuer our care be to teach plainely and euidently, yet the carnall reaſon of a naturall man miniſtreth many cauilles and queſtions, whereby diuerſe ſcruples remaine in the hearts of the people, as dangerous ſtumbling blockes to turne them out of the right way, &amp; to ſtay their courſe from running with a right foot in the paths of righteouſneſſe. Wherefore it ſtandeth vs vpon, to conſider diligently, what may be alleaged againſt the truth that is taught by vs, and to make a plaine anſwere vnto the ſame. This we ſee in euery Epiſtle practiſed by the Apoſtle. When he had taught free iuſtification <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 3, 20. 21, 22, 27, 28, 31.</note> by faith apprehending Chriſt without the workes of the Law, the Iewes might haue obiected; If the law do not iuſtifie, then it was giuen in vaine, it is aboliſhed, it ſerueth to no purpoſe. He knew this would be concluded, and therefore he preuenteth it; ſaying, <hi>Doe we then make the Law of none effect through faith? God forbid: yea, we eſtabliſh the law.</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 5. 20. with Chap. 6. 1, 2.</note> hauing taught that <hi>where ſinne abounded, there grace abounded much more,</hi> if he had rawly and barely left the matter thus propounded, a man might haue obiected; If this be true, that there grace aboundeth where ſinne hath abounded, then ſinne ſeemeth to be the cauſe of Gods glory, and then why do we not ſinne fully and freely, that thereby the glory of God may be magnified? Wherefore he vnloſeth this knot in the words and chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter immediately following, <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? Shall we continue ſtill in ſin that grace may abound? God forbid: How ſhall we that are dead to ſinne, liue yet therein?</hi> Likewiſe to the ſame purpoſe he ſpeaketh againe, for hauing proued that ſinne ſhall not haue dominion ouer vs, <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 6, 14, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe we are not vnder the law, but vnder grace,</hi> conſidering with himſelfe, that prophane men might abuſe the grace and liberty of the Goſpell to commit ſinne with greedineſſe, hee replieth, <hi>What then? ſhall we ſinne, becauſe we are not vnder the law, but vnder grace? God forbid, &amp;c.</hi> The like we ſee practiſed in other places: When hee hath taught the Epheſians to <hi>loue their Wiues as their owne bodies, yea euen as Chriſt loued the Church,</hi> and addeth, <hi>that this</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Ephe. 5, 32.</note> 
                  <hi>is a great ſecret or myſtery:</hi> a man might aske, do you ſpeake this of the loue that ought to be betweene the Husband and the Wife, or of the loue that is betweene Chriſt and his Church? he anſweareth, <hi>I ſpeake concerning Chriſt, and concerning the Church.</hi> In like manner deliuering a rule to the Church, that Widdowes ſhould bee choſen to attend vpon the ſicke and thoſe that were diſeaſed, he would haue none vnder threeſcore yeares of age ſet a part to this Office, he addeth, <note n="e" place="margin">1. Tim. 5, 9, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>But refuſe the younger Widdowes, for when they haue begunne to wax wanton a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt, they will marry, hauing damnation:</hi> The Apoſtle knowing that theſe wordes might haue beene wreſted wrongfully and applyed contrary to his meaning, (for one might haue ſaid, what, haue they damnation for mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying? Is marriage the cauſe of damnation?) He reſteth not ſo, but anſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the point, <hi>they haue damnation for denying and breaking their firſt faith.</hi> This wiſedome is to be put in practiſe of all the Miniſters of Gods word, wee muſt be able not onely to teach, but to conuince, and to fore-ſee what may be obiected againſt that which we haue deliuered. So then the Miniſters muſt be men of knowledge, throughly furniſhed to conuince the aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and repleniſhed with ſtore, both new and old, to ouerthrow all ſpirits of contradiction that ſeeke to ſubuert and deſtroy the faith of many. And it belongeth to the people to reſort and repaire to their Miniſters thus qualli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, for reſolution of doubts wherewith they are troubled, <note n="f" place="margin">Mal. 2, 7. Math. 2, 4.</note> conſidering with themſelues that the Prieſts lips muſt preſerue knowledge, and that the people are to ſeeke the law at their mouthes, becauſe they are the Meſſengers of the Lord of Hoaſtes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we ſee againe in the firſt wordes of hurting and owing, that
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:7222:195"/> there is vſed a certaine mitigation. For whereas he might haue called him a Theefe and Runnagate, he expreſſeth them vnder much milder names, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his robbing and flying away, an hurting, and debt; declaring thereby, how gentle and eaſie an hand, how louing and charitable an heart, we ought to beare, toward the penitent. We are not to aggrauate the ſlippes and fals, nor augment the ſinnes and offences of our brethren, nor to vrge them and ſet them out in their colours to the vttermoſt, nor to follow them with extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, but it is our duty to deale mercifully with ſuch ſinners as are vnfained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truely turned vnto God, <note n="g" place="margin" type="runSum">Three rules to be obſerued to moue vs to deale merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly toward the penitent.</note> remembring alwaies theſe three thinges. Firſt, that we are ſubiect to the like ſinnes, and may be ouertaken with the ſame offences, through the tentations of Sathan, and the corruptions of our owne nature. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle admoniſheth vs, <note n="h" place="margin">Gal. 6, 1.</note> to reſtore ſuch as haue fallen, euen with the ſpirit of meekneſſe, conſidering alſo our ſelues leaſt we alſo be tempted. Secondly, that as we are ſubiect to fall, ſo we haue offended as greatly againſt God as they, if not in the ſame kind and after the ſame manner; ſo that if he ſhould enter into iudgement with vs, who could ſtand in his preſence, or anſweare him one of a thouſand? This is it which Chriſt Ieſus laid to the charge of the proud Phariſies, when they brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him the woman taken in adultery, he ſaid vnto them, <note n="i" place="margin">Iohn. 8, 7, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Let him that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you without ſinne, caſt the firſt ſtone at her: who, when they heard it, being accuſed of their owne conſciences, went out one by one, beginning at the eldeſt euen to the laſt.</hi> Thirdly, that we do deſire and obtaine fogiueneſſe of our ſinnes vpon this condition, that we forgiue others, when we are taught to ſay; <note n="k" place="margin">Mcth. 6, 12, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue vs our treſpaſſes, as we forgiue them that treſpaſſe againſt vs.</hi> Wherefore, let vs be of a gentle minde and placable nature, eaſie to be intreated, ready to be perſwaded, willing to be reconciled, and forward to forgiue all iniuries and wronges offered vnto vs: without which affection al our praiers to God, and all the parts of his worſhip, are made void and nothing worth vnto vs. Hence it is, that we are moued, when we haue brought our guift to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, then and there remembring <note n="l" place="margin">Math. 5, 23, 24.</note> that our brother hath ought againſt vs, to depart and leaue our offering vntill wee be reconciled vnto him. Of this point we haue ſpoken before: yet the great neceſſity of it, and the preſent vſe of the Lordes ſupper, which is a Sacrament of loue and vnity, requireth the renewing of it; and therefore, vnleſſe it be to thoſe that are dead-hearted and heauy eared, that will neither heare, nor marke, nor vnderſtand, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, it cannot but worke ſome grace and conſcience in them that haue their eares opened, boared and prepared.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, note the ſingular loue and exceeding compaſſion in the Apoſtle, offering himſelfe to become ſurety; yea, to enter into bandes for ſo baſe a ſeruant as had ſtollen away his Maiſters goods, and ranne away for feare of puniſhment. Heerein is great loue; and heerein Chriſt Ieſus teſtifieth his loue to his Church, <note n="m" place="margin">2.

               <p>Fourthly, we may learne that the imputation of another mans debt, may ſtand with the law of God and man, ſo that by all law diuine and humaine he is reputed and holden a debter, that offereth and maketh himſelfe ſurety for another, ſo that he is iuſtly charged to be the debter and the other man for whom he becommeth ſurety is diſcharged and freed from the debt: yea, the ſatisfaction of another is imputed to the debter, euen as his debt is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the ſurety. This beeing cleerc and euident in all Law, and by all reaſon, why ſhould it ſeeme a maruailous, or rather a monſtrous thing in the eyes and eares of our aduerſaries, either that our ſinnes ſhould be imputed to

Nay he is more iuſt and righteous that hath Chriſtes righteouſneſſe made his, then if he had an inherent righteouſneſſe of his owne, albeit it were perfect and compleate, full and abſolute, without all ſtaine and imperfection. For Chriſts imputed righteouſneſſe is more worth and worthy then all the inherent righteouſneſſe that is in men and Angels: yea that imputed righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is more accepted and reſpected of God, then all the righteouſneſſe that is found in the Angels themſelues: and when we ſhall liue with Chriſt our head in the Heauens, albeit we ſhall haue perfect righteouſneſſe inherenr in vs, and be like the Angels which alwaies enioy the preſence of God, and behold the beauty of his face, yet euen then we ſhall appeare more glorious, gratious, and accepted of God, through that righteouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed vnto vs (which we ſhall neuer looſe nor put off, no not when we ſhall be in immortallity) then for this inherent ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication when it is at the higheſt toppe and in the greateſt perfection, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any want or weakneſſe.</p>

               <p>Firſt, that all of vs enioy more then we deſerue, and can iuſtly challenge at the hands of God. If we would haue a crum of bread, wee muſt craue it of him, and ſay, <note n="l" place="margin">Math. 6, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Giue vs this day our daily bread.</hi>

               <pb n="371" facs="tcp:7222:199"/>
               <p>Secondly, that we oftentimes doe want outward thinges, becauſe we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme no more of inward graces and ſpirituall bleſſings. We haue no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God to beſtow vpon vs earthly gifts, any farther then we aske by prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſeeke by faith heauenly things, according to the ſaying of Chriſt; <note n="m" place="margin">Math. 6, 33.</note> 
                  <hi>First ſeeke the Kingdome of God and his righteouſneſſe, and all theſe thinges ſhall be ministred vnto you.</hi> It is therefore Gods great iudgement vpon ſuch grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and thankleſſe men, as contemne theſe thinges that belong to a better life, that oftentimes they are brought to feele the want of the tranſitory things of this life.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie, that it is a great ſubtiltie and pollicy of Sathan, to inueigle and intangle our mindes with the deſire of ſuch benefits as we want, thereby to cauſe vs to murmure, and to mooue vs to diſtruſt for them, and to diſgrace the preſent benefits which we enioy, and ſo to prouoke vs to be vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.

               <p>Fourthly, that the Lord doth not alwayes actually beſtow vpon his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the riches and wealth of this World, but nurtereth them vp to depend whollie vpon his faithfull promiſe, who hath giuen them his word, that hee will not leaue them nor forſake them. And in the meane ſeaſon, he worketh in their hearts a patient bearing of the wants and neceſsities of this life, but in the end, he will beſtow vpon them eternall bleſsings that neuer ſhall haue end, and heauenly graces that neuer ſhall decay.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that one drop of Gods fauour toward vs, is better worth, and more of value, then this whole World, that is but vaine and tranſitory. If wee cannot reſt in this fauour of God, in the want of outward thinges, it is moſt certaine we haue not yet learned truely to prize, and rightlie eſteeme the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God. Such as cannot bee content to forgoe and forſake earthlie things, neuer truelie felt the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes.

               <p>Laſtly, we muſt remember that Nature is content with a little; ſo that if we haue food and raiment, we ought to be content, as we noted before. This was the vow of <hi>Iacob</hi> when he went from his Fathers houſe, while he was in the way to <hi>Haran;</hi>

Some are poore, and ſome are rich; ſome noble, &amp; ſome vn-noble; ſome high, and ſome low. The beginning of all is equall; the end of all alſo is equall touching this life: for as we brought nothing into this world, ſo we can carry nothing away with vs, We came <note n="q" place="margin">Iob 1, 21.</note> 
                  <hi>naked out of our mothers womb, and naked we ſhall return thither.</hi> The time betweene our riſing and falling, our birth and death, is of ſhort
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:7222:200" rendition="simple:additions"/> continuance, and therefore we ought not to be carefull to heape vp Riches, <note n="r" place="margin">Pſal. 49, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>For as much as we ſhall take nothing away when we dye, neyther ſhall our pompe deſcend after vs.</hi> If a Man haue neede of one onely Pot or Pitcher of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is ſmall wiſedome and great vanity to try to draw vp a whole ſtreame. If a little prouiſion will ſerue for the iourney and voyage that we vndertake, it is a needeleſſe and bootleſſe thing to hoard and heap vp great ſtore of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture for a ſmall occaſion. Let vs therefore take heede of all exceſſe, and content our ſelues with the moderate vſe of outward bleſſinges, enioying ſuch thinges as we haue with cheerefulneſſe and thankfulneſſe, bearing the want of ſuch thinges as we haue not, with patience and meekeneſſe, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon GOD for his bleſſing, in all thinges that any way concerne and belong vnto vs. To loue Riches, is a token of a baſe and abiect minde; to couet and deſire them when we want them, is a ſigne of a wretched and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable minde; to vſe them well to our priuate commoditie, and the publike vtilitie when we haue them, is a Teſtimonie of a commendable and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mind.</p>

               <p>This truth is confirmed vnto vs by diuers examples, of ſuch as haue gone
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:7222:201" rendition="simple:additions"/> before vs in the practiſe of this dutie. When <hi>Iacob</hi> refuſed to ſend his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt and beloued Sonne <hi>Beniamin</hi> (whom he begat in his old age) into <hi>Egipt</hi> with his other Sonnes to fetch Corne, ſaying; <hi>Ye haue robbed me of my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: Ioſeph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Beniamin: all theſe things are againſt me.</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Gene. 42, 36 37.</note> Then <hi>Ruben</hi> anſwered his Father, ſaying; <hi>Slay my two Sons if I bring him not to thee againe: deliuer him to mine hand, and I will bring him to thee againe.</hi> Where we ſee, he offereth his Sonnes in hoſtage, and was ready to deliuer them as pledges, and to binde to his Father, Man for Man, Sonne for Sonne, bodie for bodie, and life for life: which is a greater matter then to be bound mony for mony, and goods for goods. The like we ſee more euidently in the Chapter following, when <hi>Iacob</hi> did hang backe, and ſeemed reſolued not to let <hi>Beniamin</hi> depart with them; <hi>Iudah</hi> is earneſt with his Father, ſaying; <note n="f" place="margin">Gene. 43, 8, 9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Send the Boy with me, that we may riſe and go, and that we may liue and not dye; both we, and thou, and our Children: I will bee ſuretie for him, of mine hand ſhalt thou require him: If I bring him not to thee, and ſet him before thee, then let me beare the blame for euer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which words we ſee, that when <hi>Iudah</hi> conſidered the cauſe of their long delay, and the extreamitie of the great dearth, and the daunger of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eſtate, that except they had made this tarrying, doubtleſſe they might haue departed from their Father, and returned to their Father againe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, he vndertaketh the matter, and becommeth ſurety for the Child. This is it which he freelie and francklie confeſſeth before <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> when they had beene brought backe to him, the Cup being found in <hi>Beniamins</hi> ſacke, <note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 44, 32.</note> 
                  <hi>Doubtleſſe thy Seruant became ſurety for the Childe to my Father,</hi> and ſaide; <hi>If I bring him not vnto thee againe, then will I beare the blame vnto my Father for euer: now therefore (I pray thee) let me thy Seruant abide for the Childe, as a Seruant to my Lord, and let the Childe go vp with his Brethren.</hi> Whereby alſo it appeareth, that he conſidering with himſelfe, that hee could not without impeachment of his credit, without breach of his promiſe, and without heauineſſe to his Father, returne to him, except the Child were with him: he offereth himſelfe as a pawne, and pledge, and priſoner to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> as before he had done to his Father.</p>
               <p>This alſo we ſee euidentlie in the Actes of the Apoſtles, when <hi>Paule</hi> was troubled fot preaching Chriſt crucified, and riſen againe from the dead, <note n="h" place="margin">Acts 17, 5, 8 9.</note> 
                  <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that the Iewes which beleeued not, moued with enuy, tooke vnto them cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vitious and Vagabond Fellowes, and hauing aſſembled the multitude, they made a tumult in the Cittie:</hi> It is ſaid, that <hi>Iaſon</hi> receiued him and other of the Brethren into his houſe, and offered to baile them, and to be bound for them, putting in good aſſurance that they ſhould appeare and be forth-comming. And if we require an example in the ſame kind and condition, with this that is mentioned in this Epiſtle: Our Sauiour expreſſeth the like, in the Parable of him that went downe from <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to <hi>Iericho,</hi> and fell among theeues, who wounded him with their weapon, and robbed him of his Raiment, and left him in his trouble, euen halfe dead: <note n="i" place="margin">Luke 10, 34, 35.</note> 
                  <hi>A certaine Samaritan (as he iourni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) came neere vnto him, and when he ſaw him, he had compaſſion on him, and went to him, and bound vp his wounds, and poured in Oyle and Wine, and put him on his owne Beaſt, and brought him to an Inne, and made prouiſion for him: and on the morrow when he departed, he tooke out two pence, and gaue them to the Hoſt, and ſaid vnto him; Take care of him, and whatſoeuer thou ſpendeſt more, when I come againe, I will recompenſe thee.</hi> This <hi>Samaritan</hi> did ſhew himſelfe a right Neighbour, both in ſhewing his preſent charity toward him, and in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering himſelfe to become a ſurety for him. All theſe approued and allowed examples of the faithfull, do ſufficiently and euidently teach vs, that it is in it ſelfe lawfull to vndertake payment for another, and to become Suretie for him.</p>

Firſt, waigh with me the example of Chriſt, an excellent patterne and preſident of the practiſe of this, an example farre beyond all exception, an example that ouerſhadoweth, and dazeleth <note n="k" place="margin">Heb. 12, 1, 2.</note> and darkneth, all that cloud of witneſſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Apoſtle in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes; he became ſurety for his Church vnto his father, to pay the debt of our ſinnes, and to ſatisfie his iuſtice. If then any doubt, or make a queſtion of the former examples, wherein we ſaw how <hi>Ruben</hi> offered himſelfe to become as a pledge to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Iudah</hi> to <hi>Ioſeph, Iaſon</hi> to the Gouernour, and the <hi>Samaritan</hi> to his Hoaſt: behold a moſt abſolute and perfect example of Chriſt Ieſus, who bound himſelfe for vs; his body for our bodies, and his ſoule for our ſoules, that our ſinfull bodies might be made cleane by his body, and our ſoules, waſhed through his moſt precious bloud. For the Prophet propheſieth, <note n="l" place="margin">Iſay. 53, 10.</note> that he ſhould make his ſoule an offering for ſinne. And Chriſt himſelfe ſaith, <note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 26, 38.

Now, humane ſociety and Chriſtian piety requireth, that one ſhould ſuſtaine and ſuccour another in their neceſſity, as we ſee in the former examples of <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben, Iudah, Iaſon,</hi> and the <hi>Samaritan</hi> before mentioned and remembred. The life of man can hardly ſtand without lending and borrowing, without letting and hiring, without buying and ſelling, without bargaining and truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one of another. It is a worke of mercy <note n="o" place="margin">Leuit. 19, 18</note> to become ſurety, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as lawfull (no doubt) as to giue or lend. The law of God commandeth vs to helpe our Neighboures, as we are able, and as they haue neede: and they are to be releeued by ſuch meanes as are in our power; by giuing, by forgiuing, by communicating to them ſuch things as we haue, and they haue not. For if we loue them, and haue true Charity in vs, we muſt not be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them, but be ready to profit them and do them good, ſo farre as wee do not hurt our ſelues.

Wee are commanded to <note n="q" place="margin">Exod. 23, 5.</note> helpe vp our enemies Oxe that is fallen, or his Aſſe that is ſunke downe vnder his burden; how much more ought we to ſhew pitty and compaſſion to our brother himſelfe, vexed with the creditor, terrified with the priſon, oppreſſed with his debt, and diſmaid and diſcouraged with the paiment at hand, that is to be made? So then, whether we do conſider that Chriſt Ieſus is made our ſurety, or that ſuretiſhip is a fruit of Chriſtian loue one toward another, in both reſpects we ſee, that in it ſelfe it is not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alowed or condemned.</p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</note> The vſes of this Doctrine are diligently to be conſidered of vs. And firſt of all, if it be lawfull and warranted to become ſurety one for another (as we haue before plainely prooued) it conuinceth and confuteth thoſe that hold it to be euill and vnlawfull, to giue their word, or offer their band, or tender their promiſe or engage themſelues any way for their brethren. Loue is a debt that we owe to all men, <note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 13, 8.</note> as the Apoſtle teſtifieth, Rom. 13. 8. and therefore we ought not to faile in the perfourmance thereof. It is imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſuppoſed by ſome, that all or the greateſt part of the controuerſies
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:7222:202" rendition="simple:additions"/> betweene man and man, and ſuites of Law, betweene party and party ariſe from hence, that things are taken vp vpon truſt, that there is borrowing and lending among vs, and that there is crediting one of another; and ſo would haue theſe quite taken away, and the Names of them vtterlie aboliſhed out of all Incorporations and Common-wealths.</p>
               <p>It is reported, that among the <hi>Turkes</hi> are few ſuites and actions commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced one againſt another, becauſe there is with them no bargaine or ſale, no buying or ſelling, but for ready Money, and for preſent pay. But this is a plaine fallation, to put that for a cauſe which indeede is not the cauſe. For the corrupt conſcience of men, the couetous deſire of Money, the greedy gaping after gaine, the malicious humour of reuenge, the bitter roote of ſtrife, and the extreame want of loue are the true cauſes of all wranglings &amp; ſuites one againſt another, not the lending and borrowing of Money or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-worth. Hence it is, that God neuer forbiddeth in his Law the vſe of hiring, or of borrowing, but rather rectifieth the iudgement, directeth the practiſe, and preſcribeth the rules of the right and lawfull vſe thereof. Hence it is that the Lord ſaith in the Law; <note n="ſ" place="margin">Ex. 22, 25, 26</note> 
                  <hi>If thou lend Money to my people; that is, to the poore with thee, thou ſhalt not be as an Vſurer vnto him, ye ſhall not oppreſſe him with Vſurie: If thou take thy Neighbours Rayment to pledge, thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it vnto him before the Sunne goe downe: for that is his couering onely, and this is his Garment, for his skinne, wherein ſhall he ſleep? Therefore when he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto me, I will heare him, for I am mercifull.</hi> In theſe words, he forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth lending vpon intereſt to the poore, and forbiddeth crueltie in retaining pawnes and pledges taken from them that are in neceſſitie, whereas they ought to be reſtored.</p>
               <p>To this end and purpoſe <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh in another place, <note n="t" place="margin">Deut. 15, 7, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>If one of thy Brethren with thee be poore, within any of thy Gates in thy Land which the Lord thy God giueth thee, thou ſhalt not harden thine heart, nor ſhut thine hand from thy poore Brother, but thou ſhalt open thine hand vnto him and ſhalt lend him ſufficient for his neede which he hath.</hi> So the Prophet ſaith; <note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 37, 21, 26.</note> 
                  <hi>The wicked bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth and payeth not againe: but the righteous is euer mercifull, he giueth and lendeth, and his ſeede enioyeth the bleſſing.</hi> To theſe ſayings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, accordeth the Commaundement of Chriſt; <note n="x" place="margin">Math. 5, 42.</note> 
                  <hi>Giue to him that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: and from him that would borrow of thee turne not away.</hi> All theſe rules of direction ſerue to inſtruct vs in the practiſe of the duties of loue, and teach vs how to behaue our ſelues in buying and borrowing, in letting and lending vnto our Bretheren that call vpon vs for our helpe in the time of neede. Secondly, heereby they are reprehended, that binde themſelues by vow or oath, from binding themſelues in any reſpect, or in any cauſe, or vpon any occaſion for any perſon. This is an vngodly and vnlawfull ſhift that ſome men vſe, to diſable and to barre themſelues from doing this work of charity, and ſhewing this fruit of loue to their Brethren. For many, to the end they might not be enwrapped and entangled in the deceitfull ſnares of ſuretiſhip, doe enter into couenant one with another, and doe firmely binde themſelues vpon a great penaltie and forfeiture, neuer to enterpoſe their credit for any man whatſoeuer. But it is ſometimes a neceſſarie dutie of piety, and a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the ſoundneſſe of our Religion, and a great comfort to our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to ſtand betweene our Brethren, and the harmes that are comming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them,</p>
               <p>It is a generall rule taught in the word of GOD, deliuered by the law of nature, and obſerued by the Gentiles; that we ſhould ſo deale with others, as we would be dealt with all our owne ſelues. It is taught by the mouth of Chriſt; <note n="y" place="margin">Luke. 6, 30, 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Giue to euery man that asketh of thee, and of him that taketh away the thinges that be thine, aske them not againe: and as ye would that men ſhould doe to you, ſo doe ye to them likewiſe.</hi> There is no man if he were in want, and
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:7222:202" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſtood in neede of the bare word, or honeſt promiſe, or firme band and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of another, but he would be ready to requeſt it, and willing to vſe it, and content to accept of it. Wherefore, we are to remember that we ought not to hang backe when as we ought to performe the like ſeruice, and to ſhew like compaſſion to our brethren. It is therefore a great ſin, and a great ſigne of the want of loue, when we are called vnto this duty, not to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward faithfully to diſcharge it. We ought at all times to be louingly affected and charitably diſpoſed one toward another; ſo that when God calleth vs, and withall enableth vs with no damage, or trouble, or loſſe to our ſelues, to deliuer our neighbor out of his miſery, then to ſhut vp our compaſſion, and to refuſe to paſſe our promiſe for him, is an euident token, that little loue and ſmall kindneſſe abideth in vs. If then, the not doing of this duty, be an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt God and our Brethren, how much more to couenant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with our ſelues or others, or to enter into great bands, that wee will neuer enter into any bands (great or little) for them that call vppon vs, and meane honeſtly to diſcharge whatſoeuer we mercifully vndertake for them? No Vow can be good, no Oath can be lawfull, no Band can be allowed, no Couenant can be equal, no promiſe can be warranted, that is not wel groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and aduiſedly vttered. For, ſeeing ſuretyſhip is not of it ſelfe, and in it ſelfe vnlawfull, to binde our ſelues wholly from it, cannot be eſteemed to be lawfull.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore in the acknowledgement of this trueth, ſhew brotherly Loue as occaſion ſerueth, as the neede of our Neighbour requireth, and as our owne ability permitteth. Some are willing to helpe their bretheren by word and deede, and are not able: In theſe <note n="z" place="margin">2 Cor. 8, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>a willing hart, and a ready mind, are to be accepted.</hi> Others, are able to do much good by their wealth, and by their word; yet they cannot be brought to ſhew any reliefe either by the one, or by the other.

But if wee vſe it, and enter into it raſhly, not rightly; ordinarily, not warily; fooliſhly, not wiſely; deſperately, not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly; if we entangle our ſelues with it, without much deliberation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good circumſpection, and without due conſideration, it becommeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull vnto vs.</p>
               <p>True it is, it is not euill in it ſelfe, but to him it turneth to bee euill, that vſeth it euilly, according to that which the Lord ſaith by the Prophet, <note n="d" place="margin">Ezek. 20, 25.</note>

                  <hi>My Sonne, if thou be ſurety for thy Neighbor, and haſt ſtricken hande with the Stranger, thou art ſnared with the wordes of thy Mouth, and art taken with the words of thine owne mouth.</hi> Where he compareth him that is free from bils and bands, and bookes of the Creditors, free from ſuretyſhip and fuch like bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, to a Bird that hath the liberty of the whole aire, to flie therein at her owne pleaſure: but he that is bound by Promiſe, or Couenant, or Statute, is like a bird in the net of the Fowler, the which (albeit ſhe flutter with hir wing and cry with her voyce, and hop with her foot, yet) is faſt caught, and may be killed, or put in the Cage. So is it with him that is entred into bandes, or hath giuen his word for another; he hath after a ſort loſt his freedome, hee ſtandeth in danger of falling into miſchiefe. Wherefore, that this giuing of aſſurance to others, and for others, either by our word or hande, may bee performed lawfully to the good of others, and not to the hurt of our ſelues, <note n="f" place="margin" type="runSum">Two thinges to be obſerued in ſuretyſhip.</note> wee muſt marke, remember, and practiſe, two points: Firſt, conſider the perſons of others for whom it is doone; Secondly, our owne perſons that doe it.</p>
               <p>Touching thoſe perſons for whom we become ſureties, we muſt know, that we are not to engage our ſelues and our credite, for euery one that will craue it at our handes, or will deſire vs to pawne our Word, and enter into bandes for them, and promiſe vs faire to ſee vs diſcharged: but in ſuch men who oftentimes haue a greater feeling of their owne wantes and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, then of freeing them out of woe, that haue pledged themſelues for them, <note n="g" place="margin" type="runSum">In the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are bound, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider three things.</note> wee are to obſerue three things. Firſt, that they be well knowne. Secondly, that they bee honeſt and godly. Thirdly, that they bee ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to pay that which they woulde haue vs bound vnto another, to aſſure him that they will pay. Theſe are the perſons that we are bound to helpe, either for Piety, or Charitie, or Honeſtie, or Amitie, or Conſanguinity, or Affinity, all which bandes do binde vs one to another, and require ſome dutie to bee performed towardes them. This is ſet downe as a ſingular point of true Wiſedome by the Wiſeman, <hi>Prou.</hi> 11, 15. <hi>Hee ſhall bee ſore vexed that is ſurety for a Stranger, and he that hateth ſuretyſhip, is ſure.</hi> And afterward in the ſame Booke, to the ſame effect, <note n="h" place="margin">Prou. 20, 16. and 27, 13.</note>

So in the former pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces his purpoſe is to teach vs to looke to our ſelues, that they be not of pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phane life and looſe behauiour, for whom we promiſe to become ſureties; they ought to bee knowne vnto vs for their honeſty and piety, that ſo our hearts may truſt and reſt in them. But ſuch as are vngodly, and giuen ouer to all licentiouſneſſe, and ſpend their dayes and wealth in beaſtly drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, will neuer make conſcience of their word or band to ſaue vs harmleſſe. They may well flatter vs till we be bound, but they regarde not to diſcharge vs after we are bound. They are vnfaithfull to God, and therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not looke to finde them faithfull to our ſelues. Whereby we ſee, how groſly they are deceiued, and how greatly they are deluded, and how ſenceleſſely they are beſotted, that will ſooner be bound for Shifters, Gamſters, Banke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>routs, Toſſe-pots, and other baſe Companions, moſt vnwilling, and moſt vnable to keepe touch with their Creditors, then ſuch as are ſober-minded, and honeſt liuers, painfull in their callings, and carefull to bring vppe their families as they ought to do. Theſe are they, that as they are looſe in life, ſo they are lauiſh of their word, and prodigal of their tongue for their conſorts. If there be any Malefactors guilty of any heynous &amp; horrible crime, they are ready to offer their word or band to baile them, and deliuer them from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and account it a tricke and token of good fellowſhip to ſtand for them, and to keepe them from their deſerued puniſhment. And therefore they are oftentimes rewarded according to their works, and left in the danger which they haue brought vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. Theſe are they that wil complain againſt the vnfaithfulneſſe of others, whereas rather they might &amp; ſhold accuſe their owne raſhneſſe and fooliſhneſſe, that ioyned with them in their impietie, and brought vpon themſelues great miſery.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">3.</note> Moreouer, as we muſt know them in the face, and in the faith, ſo we muſt hearken after their ſufficiency. We muſt not vndertake much for them, that are not able to diſcharge a little. It is notably ſaide of <hi>Salomon,</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Prou. 13, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>There is that maketh himſelfe rich, hauing nothing; and that maketh himſelfe poore, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing great riches;</hi> that is, a man cannot rightly iudge of the eſtate of euerie one by their courſe of life, and outward carriage: many being poore, and in debt, being Bankrouts and broken fellowes, make ſhew of great wealth, by putting on braue apparrel, by delighting in coſtly fare, by ſetting vp ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous buildinges, by frequenting chargeable company, and by keeping a great port: this is exceeding vanity, and endeth in beggery. Others, on the other ſide, faigne themſelues needy, and complain of pouerty; they go bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and fare hardly, as if they were nothing worth, who notwithſtanding are of great wealth and ſubſtance: This is extreame parſimony, and endeth in miſery.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore, it is ſo ordinary and common for men to diſſemble their eſtates, by making it ſeeme better then it is, we muſt be wiſe-hearted, not to
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:7222:204"/> thinke all Gold that gliſtereth. The world is full of thoſe that lift vp them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in pride aboue that they are indeede, and make ſhew of that which is not in them in truth, and thereby endanger thoſe that looke no neerer, and try no further then the outward pompe and appearance. Theſe are like thoſe running ſtreames, that promiſe continuance, and yet incontinently are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp, and deceiue ſuch as truſted in them; or like thoſe liuing creatures that ſtouer with their winges and feathers, or raiſe vp their backes and briſtles, whereby they ſeeme much greater then Nature hath made them: Or like to Quagmyres, that apeare faire without, but if you com neere them, you ſtand in danger to be plunged in them, and to periſh by them. Thus we ſee what is to be conſidered of vs, in making our ſelues ſureties for others; Namely, that in regard of their perſons, we muſt know them thoroughly, wee muſt haue experience of their honeſty, and we muſt learne what is their ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: But if they be ſtrangers vtterly vnknowne vnto vs, if they be Varlets void of Conſcience and fidelity, if they be boaſting and bragging mates without ſubſtance and ability, let vs take heede we do not ſtrike hand for them, nor bee deceiued by them, nor offer our ſelues as pledges or ſureties for them, which is ſeldome done without hurt, neuer without danger.</p>
               <p>Secondly, touching our owne perſons, <note n="p" place="margin" type="runSum">In our owne perſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſureties, we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider two thinges; the quantity, and their ability.</note> before wee are to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to band or ſuretyſhip for others, wee muſt marke and meditate vppon two things. Firſt, what is the ſumme for which we ſhall be obliged. Secondly, the meanes how we may be diſcharged. It ſtandeth vs greatly vpon, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke our ſelues both what is the quantity, and what is our ability to anſwer it. It is a morrall precept, and wiſe ſaying worthy to be written in our harts, <note n="q" place="margin">Eccles. 8, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Be not ſurety aboue thy power: for if thou be ſurety, thinke to pay it.</hi> So then, there is more required of vs, then to looke to the perſons of others, who they are, and what they are. It is a vaine thing to be wiſe abroad, and fooliſh at home; to be ſharpe-ſighted in prying into the eſtates of others, and neuer to enter into the conſideration of our owne. For whatſoeuer the perſons bee, and whatſoeuer their earneſtneſſe be, draw not a Bow aboue thy ſtrength. Albeit they bee not enemies vnto vs, but friends; not ſtraungers, but well knowne; not hatefull perſons, but moſt deare vnto thee; not looſe Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but honeſt and godly minded: yet be well aduiſed what thou do, and looke before thou leape. If it be for thy aſſured friend, that is as thy ſoule; if it were for thy Brother, the Sonne of thy Mother; if it were for thy Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that is of thine own blood; if it were for thine own ſonne, that is thine owne fleſh, yet engage not thy ſelfe ſo farre, promiſe not ſo much, bind not thy ſelfe in ſo great a ſumme, as may impaire thy eſtate, hurt thy family, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy trade, diminiſh thy ſtocke, and vndo thy poſterity, if the debt ſhould be required of thee, and the ſtone be rolled vpon thee. For whoſoeuer gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his word and promiſe for another, bindeth himſelfe to pay and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge that debt wherein the principall party faileth: and the Creditor of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes relyeth more vpon the ſufficiency of the aſſurer, then vpon the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty of the borrower. We are in kindneſſe and curteſie ſo to pleaſure ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as that no man is bound to vndo, or to hinder himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Let euery man therefore well waigh his owne ſtrength. It were fooliſh pitty for the ſauing of another mans life to looſe our owne. It were amerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe kinde of mercy to leape into the water, and drowne our ſelues, while we ſeeke to deliuer another. We are bound to haue <note n="r" place="margin">Iude verſ. 23</note> compaſſion of ſome, pulling them out of the fire, when we ſee them in danger to be burned; but it were more then childiſh to runne into the fire, and ſo burne our ſelues. We are <note n="ſ" place="margin">Gal. 6, 2.</note> commanded to bear the burthen one of another, but it were more then ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh pitty to breake our owne ſhoulders, by ſuſtaining the waight and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the burthen of another man. Againe, as wee are to marke our owne ſtrength, ſo we are to conſider our owne diſcharge, how we may be ſecured
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:7222:204"/> and ſet at liberty. For, before we paſſe our word, or giue our band &amp; hand for the payment of other mens debtes and duties, we muſt know how wee ſhall bee aſſured to be deliuered from that burthen and bondage that wee haue vndertaken. We ought indeede to beare good will to all men, but our good will ſhould not be a looſer. It is no Charitie to receiue a blowe vpon our owne heads, to keepe the ſtocke from another. So then, let vs remember theſe few points fit to be learned and practiſed of vs. Knowe what kinde of man hee is for whome thou becommeſt a ſurety. If he be a ſtranger to thee, meddle not with him: if he haue broken his credite with any before, ſuſpect him: if he bee a ſhifting Companion, diſcard him; if he bee vnſufficient to pay his owne debt, deny him; if the ſumme bee great, and thy ability little, ſo that it may hinder thee and thy Calling, if thou be driuen to pay it, enter not into it; and if thou canſt not ſee which way thou mayeſt be freed from the perrill and daunger that hangeth ouer thy head, flye away from it, as from a Serpent that will ſting thee, as from a Canker that will conſume thee, as from a Gulfe that is readie to ſwallow thee.</p>

Wee ſee generally, that they which haue the leaſt purpoſe to pay, and the ſmalleſt care to performe that which they haue promiſed, are for the moſt part moſt forward to vndertake and offer themſelues, their words, their wealth, their bandes, their bodies for other men. But ſuch as are moſt carefull and Conſcionable in payeng their Debtes, anſwearing the Arrerages that accrew by the falſe-hoode of faigned friends, are moſt backeward to yeelde their neckes to this yoake, aſſuring themſelues, that it is farre better to walke at libertie, then to haue his feete put in the Stockes for Correction.

No cruelty toward any is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. If it be a Malefactor that hath committed an heynous crime, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the puniſhment of death, he is not to bee proceeded againſt with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of priuate reuenge, and a ſatisfying of our cruell minde, and a thirſting after blood. If it be a Debter that is fallen into decay, hee is to bee dealt withall in Mercie and Commiſſeration, not with Rigour and Seueritie. If then, wee are to deale ſo with a Debter, much more with a ſurety. When we ſee a man that hath beene well aduiſed in it, and circumſpect to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent daungers, and foreſee damages ſo farre as the eye of mans vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and iudgment can reach, we ought not to take aduantage of his error, but to ſhew him what fauour poſsibly we can. If thou ſeeſt him fallen into thy hands, deale with al mercifulneſſe toward him, and conſider not ſo much what thou mayſt do by Law, as what thou oughteſt to do in loue: neyther thinke what rigour of Iuſtice will permit, but what the right of equity will allow thee to do.

I ſay, when Debtes are owing, when bargaines are made, when money is lent, when Lands are ſolde, and when there are mutuall Contracts betweene man and man; betweene Friend and Friend; betweene Kinſman and Kinſman; aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in writing with hand and ſeale may be enterchangeably giuen and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. This we ſee in the practiſe of all people in former times. When <hi>Abraham</hi> had made a Couenant of peace and vnitie with <hi>Abimelech</hi> K. of <hi>Gerar,</hi> he did deliuer vnto him ſeauen Lambes, <note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 21, 39 23.</note> 
                  <hi>That the taking of them might be a witneſſe of the truth, and an aſſurance vnto him that he hadde digged that Well of waters.</hi> To this purpoſe, did the King require <hi>Abraham</hi> to take an Oath and ſolemnely to ſweare by the name of God, that hee woulde not deale falſely and fraudulently with him, nor hurt him, nor his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, nor his Childrens Children. The like (or rather greater) aſſuraunce is required and yeelded in the 23. Chapter of the ſame Booke, where <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> buying a fielde of <hi>Ephron</hi> the Hittite, requireth an Inſtrument with witneſſes, and a deliuerie of the poſſeſſion, <hi>The Field of Ephron,</hi>

                  <hi>which was in Machpelah, and ouer againſt Mamre, euen the Fielde and the Caue that was therein, and all the Trees that were in the Fielde, which were in all the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders round about, was made ſure vnto Abraham for a poſſeſſion, in the ſight of the Hittites, euen of all that went in at the gates of his Cittie.</hi> Where we ſee, all the circumſtances and manner of the contract which <hi>Abraham</hi> maketh are ſet downe and expreſſed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we ſee a large deſcription of the place that was bought, together with the bounding and confronting of the place, as alſo the appurtenances; Namely, the Trees that grew therein. Secondly, wee ſee the name of the ſeller ſet downe, who did openly auouch the ſale thereof, as being his owne. Thirdly, the name of the buyer, that no doubt might be left. Laſtly, the witneſſes are recorded of this bargaine and ſale, that none might heereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet lay claime vnto it, or denie vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> the lawful poſſeſsion of it, and the holding of it to him and his. And if we would yet ſee this more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wee haue more euident confirmation of it in the propheſies of Ieremie, where to ſhew the certainety of the returne of the Iſraelites into their Lande and Countrey againe, hee maketh a ſolemne purchaſe, <note n="o" place="margin">Ier. 32, 9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>I bought the Fielde of Hanameel mine Vncles ſonne, and waighed him Siluer, euen ſeauen Shekels, &amp; ten peeces of Siluer; and I writ in the Booke, and ſigned it, and tooke witneſſes, and I gaue the Booke of the poſſeſsion vnto Baruch, in the ſight of Hanameel mine Vnckles Sonne, and in the preſence of the Witneſſes, which were vvritten in the Booke of the poſſeſsion, before all the Iewes that ſate in the Court of the Priſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe wordes (which are more at large related in the Prophet) wee ſee what aſſuraunce and ſecuritie was taken and giuen, with VVriting, Sealing, VVitneſſes, deliuerie and keeping the Rolles and Records there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. This is ſet downe likewiſe, in the latter end of the ſame Chapter, <hi>Ieremy</hi> 32. 43, 44. where he ſaith, <hi>The Fields ſhall bee poſſeſſed in this Lande, whereof ye ſay, It is deſolate, without Man or Beast, and ſhall bee giuen into the hand of the Caldeans: Men ſhall buy Fieldes for Siluer, and make Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges, and ſeale them, and take witneſſes in the Lande of Beniamin, and rounde about Ieruſalem, &amp;c. for I will cauſe their Captiuitie to returne, ſayth the Lord.</hi> This diſcouereth the practiſe of thoſe times, and deliuereth the formes and faſhions obſerued among that people.

<pb n="386" facs="tcp:7222:207" rendition="simple:additions"/> both, they confirmed it by Oath, and ſet vp an heape of ſtones, to teſtify the amity and friendſhip renewed betweene both parties. In the Parable of the vniuſt Steward it is remembred, that all Debters and Debts were recorded in writing, with the ſumme that euery one owed: <note n="r" place="margin">Lu. 16, 5, 6, 7</note> 
                  <hi>For hee called vnto euerie one of his Maiſters Debters, and ſaide vnto the firſt: How much oweſt thou vnto my Maiſter? And he ſaide, An hundred meaſures of Oyle. And he ſaid to him, Take thy writing, and ſit downe quickly, and write fifty. Then ſaide he to another, How much oweſt thou? And he ſaide, An hundred meaſures of Wheate: Then he ſaide to him, take thy writing, and write foureſcore.</hi> In this Parable, wee ſee the manner that was vſed in the dayes of old; namely, that Bookes of reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and accounts were commonly kept, and vſually brought foorth, when men did leuell their debts, and make euen one with another. All which Teſtimonies, ratifying the practiſe of former times &amp; perſons, ſerue to teach vs, that it is lawfull for the faithfull, to vſe all circumſpection to aſſure their debts, bargaines, and contracts one with another.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 1</note> And if we would enter into a further conſideration of this truth, we ſhall ſee a plaine confirmation of it by ſundry reaſons. For firſt, it is a common Prouerbe among vs, <hi>Faſt binde, faſt finde.</hi> That which is looſely bounde, is lightly loſt; but a three-fold Cord well tyed and twiſted by worde, by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, by ſeale, is not eaſily broken. A word affirmeth, a writing confirmeth, a ſeale aſſureth, and euery one of them bindeth to performe our promiſe. We ſee by daily experience, that men are both mortall and mutable, and wordes proue oftentimes but winde, albeit ratified with the greateſt ſolemnitie. True it is, our word ought to be as good as a thouſand Obligations, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite is bred naturally in our hearts, ſo that we cannot ground vpon the bare word of men to finde good dealing. Otherwiſe, the Lord would neuer haue giuen <note n="ſ" place="margin">Leuit. 19, 11 13.</note> ſo many Lawes to reſtraine wrong and Iniuſtice, fraud and oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. All theſe, or at leaſt a great part of them are preuented, by ſetting downe our Couenants and Agreements in Writing, vnder our hands and ſeales.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 2.</note> Secondly, it is needfull to haue this manner of dealing among vs, to the end that equity and vpright dealing might be obſerued among vs, and that all occaſions of wrangling and wreſting of wordes and bargaines, may bee cut off, as with the ſword of Iuſtice. This is it which the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth in the 32. Chapter of his propheſies, mentioned before, where the Doctrine hath his confirmation, <note n="t" place="margin">Ier. 32, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoaſtes, the God of Iſraell, Take the writings, euen this Booke of the poſſeſſion; both that is ſealed, and this Booke that is open, and put them in an earthen veſſell, that they may continue a long time.</hi> Where he maketh mention of a double writing or inſtrument, which is heere called aftet the manner of the Hebrewes [<hi>A Booke,</hi>] One of them was vnſealed; the other, was ſealed, and ſo concealed; &amp; both of them were euidences to aſſure vnto him the Land that he bought and purchaſed. That which was ſealed, ſeemeth to be the Original, and as it were the Court Rolles authentically recorded and laide vp for the perpetuall rememberance of the matter. That which was open and vnſealed, ſeemeth to bee a Coppie, deliuered and taken word for word out of the former, to bee carried about with them into Captiuitie. The end of both was for continuance, that the bargaine and ſale that paſſed betweene them, might neuer bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 3.</note> Thirdly, that all occaſion of Controuerſie and couzenage might bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. For if there were no writinges to ſhew (the memories of men being fraile, and their practiſes being vnfaithfull) the world would bee full of all looſe dealings, and concord would bee baniſhed from among men. The end why <hi>Abraham</hi> ſet ſeauen Lambes by themſelues, <note n="u" place="margin">Gen. 21, 30.</note> was; becauſe <hi>Abimelech</hi> ſhould receiue them at his handes, to be a witneſſe of their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:7222:207"/> and that all controuerſies were finiſhed and ended betweene them. It appeareth many times, when proofes in writing faile, that falſe witneſſes are ſuborned, and ſo the ſeates of Iuſtice are ſubuerted: all which are eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied, when good aſſurances are at the firſt taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 4.</note> Fourthly, good aſſurance is to be allowed and receiued, to the end wee may ſafely diſpoſe of ſuch thinges as are in our power and poſſeſsion, eyther to our poſteritie or otherwiſe. Hence hath beene in all ages, the lawdable and commendale vſe of making Willes and Teſtaments, which the word of God approoueth, by deliuering diuers rules belonging to that profeſsion. The Law of God and of Nature, hath taught; that the Will and Teſtament of the dead, ought <note n="x" place="margin">Gal. 3, 15.</note> not to be abrogated or altered: and that no <note n="y" place="margin">Heb. 9, 13.</note> Will is of force vntil the Teſtator be dead. Now, we know not whether the gifts that we giue, &amp; the Legacies that we bequeath, be of our own proper goods, or the goods of other men, except we haue before hand a ſufficient aſſurance of them made vnto vs. Seeing therefore, where there is a faſt knot, there is a ſure keeping; ſeeing vpright dealing is to bee obſerued; ſeeing occaſions of quarrels and contentions are to be ſtopped; and ſeeing the goods that God hath giuen vnto vs, are rightly to be beſtowed: it followeth, that euery one is to prouide for the ſecurity and quietneſſe of his eſtate by all lawful means, not onely by word of mouth, but by aſſurance in writing, that thereby hee may foreſee the danger that may come vpon him, and be wary and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in all his doings; according to the ſaying of Chriſt, the Teacher and Author of true wiſedome, <note n="z" place="margin">Math. 10, 16</note> 
                  <hi>Be ye wiſe as Serpents, and innocent as Doues.</hi> For if wiſedome doe ſeaſon all our affaires, then alſo our contracts, that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in this life.</p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</note> We haue heard this Doctrine confirmed: Now let vs ſee how it may bee applyed, and what vſes may be concluded out of it. Firſt of all, it ſetueth for reproofe of the Anabaptiſts, who are heereby directly ouerthrowne, that condemne the propertie of goods and poſſeſsions, together with all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts and conditions that paſſe from one to another. For we haue ſhewed, that bargaines and ſales are lawfull, not onely among the Gentiles, but euen among the Chriſtians; not onely vnder the rudiments of the Law, but in the times of the Goſpell. The end of ſuch writings Obligatory is nothing elſe, but to aſſure euery one of his owne, and to make it appeare what belongeth to another man. If then it be lawfull to poſſeſſe Houſe and Landes; Money and moounables, as our owne ſubſtance; it is as lawfull to craue and take aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the poſſeſsion of them, that they may not by fraudulent meanes be alienated from vs. But of this we haue ſpoken before. Secondlie, they are reprehended, who are offended that men in theſe caſes will not truſt them, and relye vpon their wordes without farther aſſurance in writing, and refuſe to giue men good ſecurity. For all is little enough, and many times too little.</p>
               <p>I haue heard it credibly affirmed and auouched by ſome Maiſter of that profeſsion, that albeit a conueyance of Land, a deede of eſtate, an Indenture of Couenants be drawne, as ſure and certaine as learned counſell can deuiſe and contriue; yet it is an eaſie matter to picke holes in them, and to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of them. We ſee daily, what quirkes and trickes of Law are broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and inuented, whereby ſuch as are ſimply and honeſtly minded, are defrauded and defeated, of Houſes, Landes, and other Chattels. Neuer was there ſo <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 62, 9.</note> little truth, and ſo great craft and cozenage in the World, as in theſe daies. Sathan himſelfe ſeemeth now to haue opened all his packe of deuiſes, and his Inſtruments as good Schollers of ſo bad a Maiſter, haue learned ſundry deuilliſh practiſes, whereby true meaning men are oftentimes notoriouſly gulled.</p>
               <p>Some there are that are thought to ſtudy little elſe, then to finde wantes
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:7222:208"/> and imperfections; in Statutes, in Leafes, in Lands, and in aſſurances giuen betweene man and man. This is the cauſe, that the Makers of our Lawes are compelled to vſe ſo many wordes, and to heap vp ſo many Tearmes, that thereby they might heale this ſore, and remedie this miſchiefe. Let vs not therefore greeue or grudge to make ſure that whereof wee haue made ſale. No man ought to be ſo ſimple as not to aske it; and no man ought to be ſo peeuiſh as to deny it. We may eaſily behold ſuch as are friends to day, to be enemies to morrow: one while they affirme, another while they deny; at one time they promiſe to pay or repay; at another they hang backe at it, and make it ſtrange that they ſhould be challenged of their promiſe.

But there is no reaſon or equity, that when wee haue receiued Money, we ſhould deny or delay to giue good ſecurity, and that other men ſhould ſtand to our curteſie. Wherefore, it is a great iniury and In-iuſtice, to require men to depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs and our word, without further aſſurance in blacke and white. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, we mean not falſely, but faithfully; not fraudulently, but honeſtly; and our Word be as firme as our Oath; and our Oath as ſure as our Band; and our Band as good as ready payment, and preſent poſſeſſion, in regard of our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt meaning and true intent: yet we cannot liue for euer, and we know not what may fall out after our deceaſe. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> But ſome man may ſay; what neede ſo much a doe among Friends?

               <p>Firſt of all, if they diſdaine not to be aduiſed and taught by vs, let the end of all their pleas and proceedings, be the finding out of the ttuth. Let this be the marke that they ſhoot at, and the ſtarre whereby they direct all their courſe, which ſeaſoneth all their pleadings (as it were) with Salt. If they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not the tryall of the truth, nor which way the cauſe go, ſo they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue their Fee; they abuſe the ballances of Iuſtice, and turne equity into In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity. God is truth, and euery one that belongeth vnto him, ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to bring the truth to light. It is a generall rule taught by the Apoſtle, <note n="f" place="margin">2 Cor. 13, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>We cannot doe any thing against the truth, but for the truth.</hi> Woe therefore vnto them that dig deepe to hide the truth, and inuent ſhifts to bury it out of ſight, that it may not take place; and do all things againſt the truth, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond rule is, that they doe not delay the cauſes of their Clients, and protract the time in hope of farther gaine; from Tearme to Tearme, and from yeare to yeare. As there may be too great haſt, ſo there may be too great delay, and there are Rockes on eyther hand; the ſafeſt courſe, is to ſaile in the midſt betweene them both, for feare of ſhipwracke. It is a dutie of the Surgeon, not to linger the curing of his Patient, and to torment him a whole yeare, where he might reſtore him in a quarter. Suites of Law are tedious and chargeable; they are as the fits of a Feauer, that vexe the body and trouble the minde. It is an euill courſe, to keepe ſores alwaies raw, and woundes greene, in hope to get Mony: So it is an vncharitable proceeding, to retaine cauſes, and to keepe them alwaies on foot, except they may haue for expedition.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, as the end of their pleading muſt bee truth and veritie, and the courſe of it without delay; ſo it is required of them, when they know the cauſe to be euill, and ſee the manifeſt ſignes of an ouerthrow, that they doe not conceale it, but diſcouer and open it vnto their Clients. They are to forewarne them of the end, that they doe not intangle themſelues in vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie and vnlawfull ſuites. It is deliuered as a dutie of the Phyſition, and of the Miniſter, when they come to a ſicke man that lyeth on his death-bed, and ſee manifeſt ſignes of death, that they doe not hide it from him, nor flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him in his ſickneſſe, ſaying; I hope you ſhall doe well and recouer, and be as merry among your Neighbours as euer you were; but rather with wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome warne him, and with diſcretion certifie him of it, to the end he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all confidence in earthly thinges, and put his whole affiance in God; according to that ſentence of the Apoſtle, <note n="g" place="margin">2 Cor. 1, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>We receiued the ſentence of death in our ſelues, becauſe we ſhould not trust in our ſelues, but in God which raiſeth the dead.</hi> Thus ought it to be with the carefull and conſcionable Lawyer, when he ſeeth the cauſe of his Clyent deſperate and languiſhing, without hope of life, he ought not to draw him on, and moue him to proceede, but perſwade him to giue ouer, and tell him the danger that will come vpon him.

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 3</note> Thirdly, from theſe aſſurances in writing, to confirme our promiſes one to another; we learn the cauſe why it pleaſed the Lord to vſe ſo many waies and meanes with vs, to giue vs his Word, his Oath, his promiſes, his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, his Couenants, and his Seales. We learne wherefore all theſe do ſerue, euen to ſtrengthen our Faith in the good meaning of God toward vs. And as he thereby aſſureth his owne graces, ſo he prouideth for our weakeneſſe. If there were in vs that meaſure of Faith that ought to be, the bare word of God might be all-ſufficient to teach vs to acknowledge him to be the God of our ſaluation, and to depend vpon him for our Redemption. But ſeeing we haue much infidelitie in vs, and are cumbred with doubting in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, it pleaſed him in great mercy to prouide a remedy for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity: ſo that we may truely ſay; where Sin abounded, Grace hath aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded much more. Thus we ſee the Lord Ieſus dealt with <hi>Thomas,</hi> one of the twelue, when he beleeued not the Reſurrection, nor thoſe that were choſen Witneſſes thereof, but ſaid; <note n="h" place="margin">Iohn 20, 25, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Except I ſee in his handes the print of the Nailes, and put my Finger into the print of the Nailes, and put mine hand into his ſide, I will not beleeue it.</hi> Heere we may behold (as in a Glaſſe) the example of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great infidelity and vnbeleefe; hee neither beleeueth, nor will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue; he will liue by ſight, and not by Faith. This was no ſmall obſtinacy and incredulity in one of the Apoſtles, who deſerued to perriſh in his ſinne. But Chriſt Ieſus raiſeth him out of this ſleepe, and offereth mercy with much compaſſion, as it were pulling him out of this danger; <hi>Put thy Finger heere, and ſee mine handes, and put forth thine hand, and put it into my ſide, and be not faithleſſe, but faithfull.</hi> This is it which the Euangeliſt <hi>Mathew</hi> ſetteth downe, Chapt. 12. <note n="i" place="margin">Math. 12. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>A bruiſed Reed ſhall he not breake, and ſmoaking Flaxe ſhall he not quench, till he bring forth iudgement vnto victory.</hi> Now, ſuch as <hi>Thomas</hi> was, ſuch we are all by Nature: we cannot be perſwaded to beleeue, except wee ſee and feele. We will not beleeue the bare word of God, but are alwaies ready to wauer through vnbeleefe.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that God in great mercy did from the beginning of the world, adde to his word his Sacraments; to aſſure his people, that as he is the GOD of truth, ſo he meaneth truely, and performeth effectually whatſoeuer hee hath promiſed. The Sacraments therefore, are as ſignes and ſeales of his promiſes, and dependances vppon the word that is gone out of his owne mouth. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of circumciſion giuen to <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſaith; <note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 4, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>He receiued the ſigne of Circumciſion, as the Seale of the righteouſneſſe of the Faith which he had, when he was vncircumciſed, that he ſhould be the Father of al them that beleeue, not being circumciſed, that righteouſneſſe might be imputed vnto them alſo.</hi> Whereby we may ſee, what the Nature of the Sacraments is, to wit; <note n="l" place="margin" type="runSum">what a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, and to what end it was inſtituted.</note> that they are viſible ſignes inſtituted of God, to ſeale vp his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in the hearts of the faithfull. The Author or efficient cauſe is God, who onely hath power and authority to appoint and ordaine them, becauſe he it is that can giue force and efficacy vnto them. The matter is the viſible ſigne: the forme is the maner of inſtitution, according to the Rites taught and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the word.</p>
               <pb n="392" facs="tcp:7222:210" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>The end is, that the faithfull may bee confirmed and ſtrengthned in the truth of GOD. The word was giuen to inſtruct the Church by hearing: the Sacraments were giuen to inſtruct the Church both by it, and by the reſt of the ſenſes. Indeede, if wee were Angels, and not men; and were Spirits without bodies, and heauenly Creatures, not earthly: we ſhould not ſtand in neede of viſible and bodily Sacraments; but becauſe our faith is feeble, and wraſtleth with Sathan, the World, the Fleſh, and ſuch Enemies; it wanteth proppes and pillers to vphold it, that it doe not fall. For albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it our Faith be mingled with doubting, &amp; aſſaulted ſtrongly with the waues of infidelity, yet it ceaſeth not to bee a true Faith. An vnperfect Faith is a ſound Faith, though it be weake; ſo that it ſtandeth vs vpon with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <note n="m" place="margin">Luke 17, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>To pray for the encreaſe thereof.</hi> Faith goeth before the Sacraments: the which without Faith, are idle and empty ſignes, without profit, without comfort, without vſe.</p>
               <p>True it is, the Infidels, as the <hi>Aegiptians, Aethiopians,</hi> and other prophane people, who neither worſhipped the true God, nor embraced the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, had the outward vſe of circumciſion (as <note n="n" place="margin">

                  </note> Hiſtories teſtifie) as alſo the Turkes and Iewes haue at this day: but their cutting off the fleſh is not the Sacrament of God, but a meere ciuill thing; yea, an euill thing. Thus then we ſee, that the Sacraments were ordained of God to help our infirmity. The promiſe of God is certaine, and his Couenant doth not wauer: neither can theſe outward Seales make it ſtronger. But it is we that ſtumble and ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and haue neede to be ſupported. And woe vnto vs if we vſe not this help and remedy left vnto vs, nor profit thereby in confidence and aſſurance of our ſaluation. For God hath after a ſort bound himſelfe vnto vs, as by an Obligation. Indeede man, notwithſtanding his wordes, his oaths, his promiſes, his bands, his ſeales, and his aſſurances; is oftentimes changeable and vnconſtant: but it is not ſo with God, whoſe word is yea, and Amen. Were it not that we are weake of Faith, and ſlow to beleeue, he needed not to ſweare by himſelfe, and by his holineſſe: hee needed not to haue ſet Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticke Seales to his Word, ſauing that he minded to leaue no place for doubting in vs.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that the Apoſtle writing to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> Chapt. 6. ſaith; <note n="o" place="margin">He. 6, 17, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>God willing more aboundantly to ſhew vnto the heires of promiſe the ſtableneſſe of his counſell, bound himſelfe by an Oath, that by two immutable thinges, wherein it was vnpoſſible that God ſhould lie, we might haue ſtrong conſolation, which haue our refuge, to lay hold vpon that hope that is ſet before vs, &amp;c.</hi> The greater meanes God hath left vnto vs, the greater faith he requireth of vs, and the more conſcionable vſe of thoſe meanes, that we may not alwaies bee Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Woe then vnto vs, if in the ſtore of ſo great mercies, and variety of ſo many meanes, we remaine diſtruſtfull, and doe not labour to gather ſtrength of faith, and aſſuraunce of comfort.

For where Money is owing, Money will make euen: a little ſumme, will be paide with a little; a great ſumme, with the like quantitie.

Firſt of all, it directeth vs to other neceſſary truths to be learned of vs. It is noted by the Apoſtle, to be one generall vſe of the Scripture; that it ſerueth and ſufficeth to teach all truth needfull to ſaluation: ſo the former point being receiued, will help vs to finde out and conclude other truthes. Firſt we learne, that whereſoeuer there is a true profeſſion; a ſound feeling; and true taſt of Religion, or ioy
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:7222:212" rendition="simple:additions"/> of ſaluation, there will be a reuerent account, and ioyfull entertainement of the teachers and publiſhers of the Goſpell. On the other ſide, a light &amp; ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der account of the Miniſters, argueth a light account of the word of Chriſt, of the doctrine of ſaluation, and of the trueneſſe of Religion. Let euery one of vs examine our owne affections, and try our owne hearts by this Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone. It is vnpoſſible to make any diuorſe betweene the true Miniſters of God, and the true Doctrine which is according to godlineſſe. He that hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth one, magnifieth the other; and hee that contemneth the one, deſpiſeth the other. Whoſoeuer it is, that being diſtempered and diſeaſed, eſteemeth of his health, or deſireth it, he will honour the Phyſitian that cureth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couereth him. He that being wounded, is throughly healed, will greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard him that gaue vnto him the ſalue to make a plaiſter. He that hath beene ignorant, and is taught the knowledge that he had not before; will make much of him that hath beene his Maiſter. This will be the behauiour of all ſuch as haue felt the burthen of their ſinnes, and beene humbled vnder the heauy ſtroke of Gods hand, and felt the vnſearchable depth of the ſore fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering and fretting within them: They are the onely men that know what neceſſary vſe there is of the Miniſters, to ſearch their wounds, to raiſe vp with comfort, to binde vppe the broken-hearted, and ſtrengthen them that are weake and ready to fall. As for thoſe that neuer knew what the Nature of ſinne is, nor felt the intollerable burthen of it, but thinke themſelues ſound, and not ſicke; heart-whole, and not diſeaſed; Liuing men by Nature, and not dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes; they take themſelues to bee in good caſe, according to the ſaying of Chriſt our Sauiour; <note n="h" place="margin">Math. 9, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>The whole neede not the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, but they that are ſicke.</hi> Thus then we ſee, how we may proue our ſelues whether we be in the Faith or not, euen by the good eſtimation that we haue of ſuch as are the bringers of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we may gather from hence, that the greateſt part of the world lyeth deepely and dangerouſly in condemnation, becauſe ſuch hath been the vnthankefulneſſe thereof toward the Miniſters and Meſſengers of Saluation, that bring glad tydings of peace vnto vs, that it neuer reſpected them, or gaue them any reuerence. We ſee this by the examples of the Prophets, of the Apoſtles, and of Chriſt himſelfe. So long as men reſolue to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their ſinnes, ſo long they will neuer bee willing to entertaine the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Goſpell; whoſe Office is, to beat downe the Kingdome of ſinne and Sathan, and to ſet vp the Kingdome of Chriſt Ieſus in the harts of Men. When <hi>Herod</hi> was determined to keepe his Brothers Wife, <note n="i" place="margin">Math. 14, 4, 5</note> he could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide to heare <hi>Iohn</hi> preach vnto him, but committed him to priſon. It is an euident ſigne of a corrupt conſcience and of a prophane hart, to account vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of thoſe whom God hath highly aduanced. The Miniſters of the Goſpell were neuer ſo much hated, ſcorned, and abhorred; they are made a common reproach and by-word for euery baſe Fellow; they are ſet forth as vppon a Stage or Scaffold, to be derided of euery Man; <note n="k" place="margin">1. Cor. 4, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>They are made as the filth of the world, and the off-ſcowring of all things vnto this time.</hi> If this be the eſtate of the Miniſters, wee may giue a true iudgement in what eſtate the cauſe of Religion ſtandeth among vs, and what harbour it findeth with the men of this age.</p>
               <p>Such as eſteeme of the Miniſters as the filth and off-ſcowring of the earth, doe alſo account the knowledge of the word as the Dregges and drauery of all other thinges. Such as reſpect not thoſe that are the meanes of faith, will alſo reiect faith it ſelfe. The Miniſters of the word and true Religion, grow vp as two Plants together; ſo long as the one is countenanced and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden, ſo long the other will flouriſh and ſpread abroad, and proſper. But if the Miniſters, that are as the Lordes Gardiners, or the dreſſers of his Vine, be euilly intreated, maliciouſly ſlandered, deſpightfully handled, and ſcorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:7222:212"/> reproached; Religion it ſelfe beginneth to faint and to languiſh, and cannot long goe free. Let vs know therefore by this ſigne, the ſickneſſe of this age, and the dangerous declining of all good things. There cannot be a more certaine token of the ruine of the Church, then when we ſee the maine poſts and cheefe pillers thereof ſet at naught. It is an eaſie matter to giue iudgement what will be the iſſue of this diſeaſe; it is no hard thing to feele the pulſes of this Generation, and to tell them that the very pangs of death are vpon them, ſo long as the ſpirituall Phiſitions of their Soules are baſe in their eyes, that deſire nothing more then to recouer them out of that deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate conſumption into which they are fallen. There is no man hath his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Spirits ſo farre ſpent, and the naturall heat ſo much waſted, but is willing to heare of a Phyſition that is able and willing to ſet him on foote againe, and to reſtore his ſtrength vnto him that hee had before. But we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo ſenſeleſſe or ſhameleſſe, and ſo dead in our ſinnes, that we haue no deſire of health, nor ſeeke after any ſpirituall Surgeons or Phiſitions to looke vnto vs in time of ſicknes. There is no diſeaſe without cure, if men of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge be enquired after, who haue the tongue of the learned to miniſter a word in due ſeaſon.</p>

               <p>He would be accounted a ſtarke foole, that being hungry, would diſlike and diſtaſt his meat, and ſo ſtarue his body through a wilfull famine, becauſe he cannot abide the Cooke that dreſſed it: or that would refuſe his drinke to quench his thirſt, becauſe he neither loueth nor liketh him that drawed it for him, and brought it vnto him. Would not hee be condemned of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame fooliſhneſſe and ſimplicity, that would not vouchſafe to receiue or looke vpon, or heare to be read, a Letter ſent vnto him from his Prince, and that for his good, becauſe hee careth not for the Meſſenger that offereth it vnto his handes?

The like folly and madneſſe is in thoſe that refuſe the word, becauſe they hate the perſon of the Miniſter that breaketh the bread of eternall Life, that doth the meſſage that God hath put in his mouth, that publiſheth in Chriſts Name a pardon of ſinne to all people that will repent and beleeue the Goſpell; that would bring them to ſaluation of their Soules, that they might not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life.</p>

               <p>The Prophet commendeth good King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who albeit hee were ſharpely reprooued, and threatned with a greeuous iudgement, hee did not breake out into raging ſpeeches, nor caſt into priſon, nor put to death the Prophet that denounced a great plague againſt him: but ſubmitted himſelfe to God, and reuerenced the word of the Prophet, ſaying; <note n="ſ" place="margin">Eſay 39, 8.</note>

               <p>Hence it is, that the Apoſtle ſaith, <note n="t" place="margin">Ro. 2, 12, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>As many as haue ſinned in the Law, ſhal be iudged by the Law, at the day when God ſhall iudge the ſecrets of men by Ieſus Chriſt, according to my Goſpell.</hi> The Iewes and Gentiles oftentimes cried out againſt him, and accounted him vnworthy to liue, yet he ſheweth that at the laſt day they ſhould be iudged, not onely according to the word, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his word; not onely according to the Goſpell, but according to his Goſpell. When the Lord was determined to giue his owne people into the hand of their enemies, and to roote them out of that good Land which hee had giuen vnto their Fathers, hee hydeth not from them the cauſe of his iudgements, but ſetteth their ſinnes in order before them, that <note n="u" place="margin">2 Chr. 36, 16</note> 
                  <hi>they mocked the Meſſengers of God, and deſpiſed his words, and miſuſed his Prophets, vntill the wrath of the Lord aroſe againſt his people, and till there was no remedy.</hi> Where we ſee, he ioyneth together the mocking of his Meſſengers, and the deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his words.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The third re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe.</note> Laſtly, it reproueth ſuch as refuſe to giue them ſufficient maintenance, and do barre them of that competent and conuenient portion that God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted vnto them in his worde. For, if ſuch as haue ſpent their ſtrength to bring vs vnto God, ought aboue all others to be regarded of vs, and haue a worthy recompenſe of their labours; ſurely, they deſerue to be checked and controlled, that deale niggardly toward them, who haue kept back nothing from them, but reuealed vnto them the whole Counſell of God. Wee ſee in this place, what the Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> challengeth at the hands of <hi>Philemon,</hi> whom he had won to the Faith; he accounteth him to owe vnto him all that he had, ſo that if he ſhould giue vnto him all the ſubſtance of his houſe; nay, his owne life, it were but due, it were but a debt that he owed vnto him. He that hath ranſomed a priſoner out of the hands of the enemies, hath iuriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and authority ouer him, and may worthily claime whatſoeuer he hath. He that hath ſaued the life of his enemy in battell, and made him captiue, is wholly at his diſpoſing that hath taken him. In like manner, ſuch as haue pulled vs out of the fire of hell, out of the Iawes of death, and out of the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of Satan the Prince of this world, that ruleth in the hearts of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience; may by a Diuine and humaine right reape, our tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things, and require to be ſuſtained and maintained by vs. Might not he be regiſtred for a moſt vnthankefull perſon to all poſterities that ſhall come heereafter, that would ſuffer him to want that hath fed him, that hath nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed him, that hath preſerued his life? Who doth not cry out againſt <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh</hi> and the Egyptians, <note n="x" place="margin">Exod 1, 8.</note> who forgat <hi>Ioſeph</hi> a great Benefactor to their whole Land, that prouided much Corne in the plentiful yeares, and ſaued the liues of many thouſands by his labour and induſtry? So likewiſe, what a ſhame is
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:7222:214"/> it, to ſuffer ſuch worthy Inſtruments of our good, to lack and ſuffer hunger? Vndoubtedly, they deſerue to be forſaken of God and all good men, that forſake thoſe that are their Fathers in Chriſt, and inſtructers in Chriſtianitie. Notwithſtanding, this blemiſh and reproach ſticketh neerer vnto many men now liuing, then the skin vppon their backes, which brandeth and blotteth them, as with a coale of perpetuall infamy; who being brought to knowe themſelues, to ſee their owne ſinnes, to vnderſtand their ſecret offences, to make Conſcience of their wayes, to come to true repentance, and to begin to ſet their footing in the kingdome of heauen, by the bleſſing of God, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the labours of his Miniſters, yet haue no conſideration of them, are not greiued nor aſhamed to ſee them want, and to liue in neceſsity, but haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten all the comfort that they haue receiued, and ſhut vp the eyes of their compaſſion from them. So often as I conſider the former times of mens zeale and forwardneſſe, that being drawne to a loue of the truth became In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to draw on others, and compare the ſame with the preſent eſtate of things, we may ſeeme to liue in a continuall Winter, and vnder a frozen Climate, wherein appeareth nothing all the yeare long, but Froſts and Ice, and cold, and Haile, and Snowes, couering the Mountaines and Valleyes, without any Spring or Summer, without any heate, or growing, or flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any thing. For I remember, how many being touched with a terror in Conſcience, and feeling the burthen of their ſins more heauy then Lead, preſſing them downe to the nethermoſt Hell, could finde no comfort in their pleaſant Companions, in their delightfull paſtimes, and in ſweet Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Muſicke, all theſe were tedious and bitter, and weariſom vnto the fleſh: one word of comfort from the mouth of the Miniſter, was as Balſam vnto them, to refreſh their faint and feeble ſpirits, by whom they were ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp. But now, liuing in peace and proſperity, they are fallen aſleepe, they remember not the kindneſſe they haue receyued, and the conſolation that they haue taſted, and can both heare and ſee their miſery, and almoſt begge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that were the greateſt meanes of their bringing them from the greateſt miſery and ſlauery that can be imagined. For, what greater bondage, then the bondage of ſinne, of Satan, and of Hell? It is a great reproach to ſee a Chriſtian Brother to begge his Bread, or to craue releefe of others: a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſter is a Chriſtian brother, and more then a Brother; yea, a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Father, whoſe Children in the faith ought to giue him maintenance in the fleſh. It is truely ſaide by the Apoſtle, <note n="y" place="margin">Gal. 6, 6, 7.</note>

This the Apoſtle commendeth vnto vs in the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">1 Theſ. 2, 13</note> 
                  <hi>For this cauſe alſo thanke we God, without ceaſing, that when ye perceiued the word of God, which ye heard of vs, ye receiued it not as the word of men, but as it is indeed the word of God, which alſo worketh in you that beleeue.</hi> Where we ſee, that after the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> had heard the Goſpell of Chriſt publiſhed vnto them, ſo many of them as were ordained vnto eternall life beleeued; and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelues to be duided and reformed by it.</p>
               <p>This dutie, hath <note n="c" place="margin" type="runSum">Foure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting our ſelues to the Goſpell.</note> manie branches. Firſt, it is required of vs to heare the worde of God with patience. This is the firſt ſtep and degree that leadeth vnto life, and it proceedeth from the meere grace and fauour of God, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it is wrought in our hearts. For, how many are there, that when they heare, ſtop their eares? That when they ſee, ſhut their eyes? That when they vnderſtand, doe harden their hearts? When <hi>Stephen</hi> made a defence for himſelfe, before the chiefe Prieſts that ſat in the Counſel, <note n="d" place="margin">Acts 7, 57.</note> 
                  <hi>They gaue a ſhout with a loud voyce, and ſtopped their eares, and ran violently vpon him all at once, and caſt him out of the Citty, and ſtoned him with ſtones.</hi> When one <hi>Alexander</hi> a Iew beckned with the hand, prepared himſelfe to ſpeak, and would haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed the Apoſtles, <note n="e" place="margin">Acts 19, 33</note> 
                  <hi>There aroſe a great ſhout almoſt for the ſpace of two houres, of all men crying, Great is Diana of the Epheſians.</hi> Likewiſe when <hi>Paule</hi> made a perticuler rehearſal of the manner of his conuerſion to the faith, before the Iewes, they heard him quietly and with ſilence, vntill he ſaid; He was ſent to the Gentiles; but then thorough impatience, <note n="f" place="margin">Acts 22, 23.</note> they cried out, they caſt off their cloathes, and threw duſt into the ayre, and lift vp their voices, ſaying; <hi>Away with ſuch a fellow from the earth, for it is not meet that he ſhould liue.</hi> We ſee by theſe examples, that it is a token of Gods goodneſſe, when he giueth vs circumciſed eares to liſten and attend to the word preached vnto vs, with patience and perſeuerance vnto the end, albeit we heare our ſins reproued, &amp; our ſecret thoughts opened vnto vs. It is our dutie to ſhew our ſelues ſwift to heare, but ſlow to ſpeake, and ſlow to wrath. We muſt be ſlow to ſpeake againſt that which hath bin deliuered, and we muſt be ſlow to anger and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt thoſe that haue deliuered the truth vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is required, that we receiue the word that we haue heard, &amp; aſſent vnto it as to the word of truth, and acknowledge it to bee good and true, euen that part of the word that containeth his iudgements, his threat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nings, his curſſes, his punniſhments. This is to be craued of God, as being a ſpecial worke of grace in thoſe that belong to his kingdom. For many there are that heare, and haue their eares open to attend; theſe are not dull hearers that marke nothing, but ate ready to liſten and giue care; and yet they will not giue their aſſent to that which they haue heard. The Apoſtle teacheth, <note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 2, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>That the naturall man perceiueth not the things of the spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſſe vnto him: neither can he know them, becauſe they are spiritually diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> When <hi>Paule</hi> preached at <hi>Athens,</hi> in the hearing of the <hi>Stoikes</hi> and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures, touching the reſurrection from the dead, they ſaide, <note n="h" place="margin">Acts 17, 18</note> 
                  <hi>What will this Babler ſay?</hi> A great part of our ordinary hearers, may be placed in this rank, who are content to heare, and then ſit in iudgement vppon that which they haue heard, and neuer giue credit vnto it, but meaſure the truth of God by their carnall conceits, and naturall reaſons.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is farther required of vs, to embrace the truth in our hearts, &amp; carefully to apply it to our owne ſoules. It belongeth vnto vs, not onely to heare it with the eare, and to aſſent to it with the mind but to lay it vp deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rooted in vs, and to make it our owne by a ſpeciall application. This is the
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:7222:215" rendition="simple:additions"/> right vſe of the word, this is peculiar to the elect, and this is a work of grace in our hearts. The Hyſtoricall faith giueth a generall conſent to the truth of God, but neuer goeth farther to apprehend it, as we ſee in <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, who is ſaid to haue beleeued, that is; in a generall maner to haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Goſpell; and yet <hi>Peter</hi> telleth him, <note n="i" place="margin">Acts 8, 21.</note> 
                  <hi>That his heart was vpright, and that he remained in the gall of bitterneſſe.</hi> Let vs not therefore approbriate the word of grace, that is able to build farther vnto our owne ſelues; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we ſhall haue no more comfort then the Reprobates haue, who come ſo farre, as to confeſſe the word to be true, and that God by his Sonne will ſaue the Veſſels of mercy.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it is required in this ſpeciall manner, to entertaine the worde, to wit; as the word of God. Many receiue the word and imbrace it willingly, readily, chearfully, and ioyfully; but not as the word of God. I wil not ſtand to ſpeake of the Church of Rome, which holdeth that the word written, hath not authority in it ſelfe, vnleſſe the Church approue it, and therefore albeit it embraceth the word of God, yet it embraceth it not as the word of God. For how many are there among our ſelues, that receiue not the word of God with that reuerence and obedience that they ought, as appeareth by the euil practiſes of their liues? Theſe men do not receiue the word of God, as the word of God, who if they did in truth &amp; ſincerity acknowledge this truth to be of God, &amp; to haue him for the author thereof, they would lead their liues in another maner then they do; they would be afraid to ruſh forward, &amp; to run headlong as it were with violence into the breach &amp; tranſgreſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. They would conſider, that God will not beare and endure the contempt of his word, but reuenge the diſhonor done to his name, with great plagues and moſt grieuous iudgments. Theſe are the duties that are to be performed of vs, and the foure degrees that teſtifie our ſubmitting of our ſelues to the truth of the Goſpel, preached &amp; deliuered vnto vs by the Miniſters of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>

This muſt teach the Miniſters of God a neceſſary duty and leſſon, to be marked of them; to wit, to endeuor by their daily diligence, and continuall preaching of the Goſpel, to make the people indebted vnto them. For how do the people come ſo much in their debt, but that they receiue heauenly Doctrine by their Miniſtry, as from the mouth of God? Such as haue need of admonition, muſt be exhorted; ſuch as are weak in the faith, muſt be ſtrengthned; ſuch as need comfort, ought to be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; ſuch as are ignorant, muſt be inſtructed; ſuch as are willing to be taught muſt be beſeeched and intreated; and euery one muſt be handled according to his nature and condition, according to the rule of the Apoſtle, <note n="k" place="margin">2 Tim. 2, 15</note>

O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue more need to haue nature reſtored, then purged, ſuch muſt haue Cordials and Reſtoratiues miniſtred vnto them. So is it with ſuch as neede Phyſicke for the ſoule. The Miniſter muſt not be dumb and ſilent among his people, but ſpeake vnto them, and inſtruct them as a good Father doeth his Childe, one after one manner, another after another manner, and euerie one by ſome meanes or other. This the Apoſtle ſetteth downe as a duty by his owne practiſe, <note n="l" place="margin">1 Theſ. 2, 7, 8 Phillip. 2, 17. Acts 20, 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Wee were gentle amongeſt you, euen as a Nurſſe cherriſheth her Children: Thus beeing affectioned towardes you, our good will was to haue dealt vnto you, not the Goſpell of GOD onely, but alſo our owne ſoules, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

So then, it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to vs the Miniſters of the word, to preach the Goſpell with all patience, diligence, and long-ſuffering. Let vs be inſtant, in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon: Let vs be gentle <note n="i" place="margin">2 Tim. 2, 24.</note> 
                  <hi>toward all men, apt to teach, ſuffering the euill, and instructing them that are contrary minded. Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Romaines,</hi> and declaring vnto them that he oftentimes purpoſed to come vnto them, that hee might haue ſome fruit alſo among them, yeeldeth this as the reaſon, <note n="k" place="margin">Ro. 1, 14, 15</note> 
                  <hi>I am Debter both to the Grecians, and to the Barbarians: both to the Wiſemen, and vnto the vnwiſe; therefore ſo much as in me is, I am readie to preach the Goſpell to you alſo that are at Rome.</hi> So in another place he teſtifieth, that <hi>Albeit he was free,</hi>

Thus we ſee how the Miniſters ought to apply, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy themſelues in labouring in the Lords harueſt, to gaine a people vnto him, and to bring them into the ſheepfold of Chriſt. For how or which way ſhould the people be indebted vnto vs, if we neuer commit the Goſpell vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them? A Debter and a Creditor are Relatiues, and haue reference one to another. If we do not ſeeke to make our hearers pertakers of the treaſures of the Goſpell, nor labour to inrich them with the ſauing knowledge of the Doctrine of ſaluation, we cannot be deare vnto them, they cannot bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted vnto vs. If we reape and receiue their temporall things, and eate and drinke, feede and cloath our ſelues by their labor, without labour in our pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we run continually into their debt, and they owe vs nothing but ſhame and contempt to be powred vpon vs, according to our deſerts. It is a great comfort to the people, that make much of them that haue the ouerſight ouer them, ſubmitting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to them that muſt giue an account for their ſouls, conſidering that thereby they may gather confidence, and get aſſurance to themſelues, that they are true beleeuers, and haue embraced the Goſpell in ſincerity. So on the other ſide, it is a ſinguler point of ſound comfort to all the Miniſters of the word, that haue bin painful in the work of the Lord, they may claime as their owne right and proper poſſeſſion of their people, to bee maintained and honoured with double honor of them, and nothing indeed can be ſufficient or anſwerable in proportion to their paines. But what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be alledged, that the people ſhould be burthened, &amp; not inſtructed? Charged with Tiths, and not helped with teaching? Pay their duties, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue no Doctrine. Hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, <note n="m" place="margin">1 Cor. 4, 1, 2</note> 
                  <hi>Let a man ſo think of vs, as of the Ministers of Christ, and diſpoſers of the ſecrets of God; and as for the rest, it is required of the diſpoſers, that euery man bee found faithfull.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee ſee, the good account and eſtimation that the Miniſter receiueth of his people, ought to mooue him to faithfulneſſe and painefulneſſe in his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; ſo that we muſt conclude, that ſuch as will be reputed for the Miniſters of Chriſt, ſhould ſhew themſelues to be ſo indeede, by their care of the flock committed vnto them.</p>

The Obiection is wanting, but may eaſily be gathered, and may be thus ſupplied out of the Anſwere which is expreſſed: Why are you ſo earneſt and vehement in this matter? Haue you ſo great diſtruſt, and ſo little confidence in me, that you vſe ſo many words, and deale ſo earneſtly with me? Do you think I haue ſo little Charitie in my ſelfe, and ſo ſmall reſpect to you, and ſo hard an hart toward him, that no perſwaſion can mollify me, no reaſon ouercome me, no friends turne me? The anſwere to this followeth: I haue written vnto thee, not becauſe I doubt of thy fauour, but becauſe I truſt in thy obedience: not becauſe I feare thou wilt deny mee, but becauſe I know thou wilt pleaſure me. This perſwaſion he amplifieth by a compariſon drawn from the greater to the leſſe, as if he ſhould ſay: Nay I am well aſſured, that for my ſake thou wilt graunt a greater matter then I craue at thy hands.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The meaning of the words.</note> Thus much is to be marked of vs touching the method, wherein we haue the concluſion of the chiefe matter, howbeit adorned with much efficacy of words, and ſtrengthned with great force of reaſons. Now let vs conſider the meaning of ſuch thinges as require interptetation. [<hi>Yea, Brother</hi>] This firſt word, is a note of exclamation, or an Aduerbe of asking, or wiſhing, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching,
<pb facs="tcp:7222:216" rendition="simple:additions"/> or hoping well; as if hee ſhould ſay: Oh my Brother, I hope that this my interceſſion for him ſhall not be in vaine, but carry ſufficient waight and authority to worke in thee moderation in relenting, and compaſſion in pardoning of him. This word of affirmation is put to garniſh the ſentence, &amp; to make the exhortation more powerfull and patheticall. When hee ſaith, <hi>Let me obtaine this fauour,</hi> or fruite; benefit or pleaſure; he vſeth the Opta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue mood, &amp; alludeth to the name of <hi>Oneſimus</hi> in the word [<hi>Onaimen</hi>] which fitly ſerueth his purpoſe. Touching theſe wordes [<hi>Comfort my Bowels.</hi>] The meaning is, receiue him, and remit his offences, and in ſo doing, thou ſhalt cheere and reuiue my hart: for the receiuing of him, is the releeuing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing of my outward parts, and of my inward affections; ſo that nothing ſhall be more pleaſing vnto me. He addeth [<hi>in the Lord,</hi>] thereby ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the duty required of him is ſuch, that it pleaſeth God, and ſetteth forth his glorie, and may Religiouſly be performed; nay ſuch, as coulde not with a ſafe Conſcience be omitted or denied. So then, hee vnderſtandeth heereby, that hee ſhould doe him a great pleaſure, and withall pleaſe God and obey him. That then which he doth requeſt, is commended by two fruites; it ſhall benefite man, and it ſhall be acceptable to God. In the 21. Verſe he ſaith, [<hi>Trusting in thine Obedience,</hi>] which is word for word (in thy hearkning vnto me) expreſſing wherein Obedience conſiſteth; Namely, in hearkning to that which is commanded, euen to hearken with a purpoſe to doe it.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe <hi>Samuell</hi> ioyneth Harkning &amp; Obeying together, <note n="a" place="margin">1 Sam. 15, 22</note> 
                  <hi>Hath the Lord as great pleaſure in Burnt-offerings and Sacrifices, as when the voyce of the Lord is obeyed? Behold, to Obey is better then Sacrifice, and to Harken is better then the fat of Rammes.</hi> So then, the vſe of this worde [<hi>of Obedience,</hi>] is not without great force, for thereby he inſinuateth, that <hi>Philemon</hi> coulde neuer eſcape the note of diſobedience, if he did not yeild to the Apoſtle of Chriſt, making ſo honeſt, ſo equall, ſo iuſt a requeſt. Laſtly, when he ſaith, [<hi>Thou wilt do no more then I ſay,</hi>] the wordes are in the Originall, [<hi>Aboue that I ſpeake,</hi>] that is; thou wilt grant more then I aske or demaund at thy hands; teſtifying heereby, the free hearts of true Chriſtians, that being prouoked to neceſſarie &amp; holy duties, they will oftentimes exceed that whereunto they are deſired. This being the right order, and true interpretation of theſe wordes, in theſe two verſes, they are thus much in effect; Oh my Brother, if thou regardeſt any good to mee, or deſireſt to pleaſure me in that which I deſire or delight in, let me obtain this benefit &amp; good turn at thy hands, which wil alſo be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God, being a work of mercy allowed &amp; commended in his word; refreſh I beſeech thee my bowels, and comfort me in my ſon <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> for what thou doſt to him heerin, ſhalbe as done to me. If thou ask me, why I vſe ſo many words, and whither I do diſtruſt of thy dealing? I anſweare, that I write nothing at all doubting, but altogether truſting thou wilt graunt my requeſt; yea, aſſuring my ſelfe, thou wilt ſhew thy ſelfe willing to grant more then I haue requeſted, euen to ſet him free if I ſhould require it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Generall Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruations out of theſe two Verſes.</note> Theſe wordes are ſhort, but the Obſeruations that ariſe from hence, might bee many: ſome I will onely point out, and afterward handle others perticularly. Firſt of all, marke the forcible farewell that the Apoſtle ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. The <hi>Concluſions</hi> and <hi>Perorations</hi> that Orators vſe, are woont to haue the ſharpeſt edge, but they are woont for the moſt part to bee long and tedious, and full of wordes; but the Apoſtle in this place vſeth the greateſt breuitie, with the greateſt vehemency: Wherein hee repeateth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the ſame manner of ſpeech, [<hi>Of refreſhing his bowels,</hi>] which we had before in the twelfe Verſe. [<hi>Thou therefore receiue him that is mine owne Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welles.</hi>] Likewiſe, as hee ſaith, [<hi>Let mee obtaine this pleaſure in the Lorde,</hi>] ſo hee doubleth it, [<hi>Comfort my bowelles in the Lorde.</hi>] This teacheth, that
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:7222:217"/> repetitions of the ſame Doctrine, are good and profitable to the Church, according to the practiſe of <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Phil. 3, 1.</note> 
                  <hi>It greeueth me not to write the ſame things to you, and for you it is a ſure thing.</hi> Let it not therefore greeue vs, or offend vs, to heare the ſame Exhortations, Reprehenſions, and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, but rather learne to lay better hold of them at the laſt, then we haue done at the firſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by theſe phraſes of obtaining a pleaſure, and refreſhing his bowels, we may learne, what ioy and comfort the godly do feele &amp; receiue in themſelues by the raiſing and reſtoring of a ſinner. It is as if wee wanted an hand, an eye, a foote, or an arme, and had it giuen vnto vs: woulde not this reioyce vs, and reuiue vs greatly? So is it with the faithfull, when they beholde a fellow member with them in Chriſts bodie reſtored and coupled with the head, from whence it receiueth a gracious influence of all ſpirituall bleſſings; it miniſtreth occaſion of the greateſt ioy that can be vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thus it ought to be with vs, when we ſee any conuerted to the faith, we ought to haue a fellow-feeling of the goodneſſe of God beſtowed vpon them, <note n="c" place="margin">Luke 15, 10.</note> inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Angels themſelues reioyce when one ſinner is conuerted.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, marke what words of beſeeching &amp; entreating he vſeth, of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deſiring him to grant his requeſt, albeit by his Apoſtolicall authority he might command him. Whereby we learn, that the godly and faithfull are more moued with mildneſſe &amp; gentleneſſe, and with louing and friendly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, then by ſeuere threatnings denounced againſt them. They are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with Gods ſpirit, which is a Maiſter to teach them, &amp; worketh in them the wil and the deed. Of vnwilling, they are made willing; of tough &amp; rough hewen, they are made pliable and apt for the building; of ſtubborn, they are become obedient &amp; ready to learn. They are as good ſchollers in the ſchool of Chriſt, who feare more the diſpleaſure of their Maiſter whom they loue, and who loueth them, then the ſuffering of many ſtripes and ſtrokes giuen vnto them. This is a true note to know the diſciples of Chriſt from al others. Euill men abſtaine from ſin for fear of the puniſhment, &amp; for feeling of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo that if there were no threatnings denounced, no curſes annexed, no plagues and torments feared, they would grow worſe and worſe, &amp; quickly fill vp the meaſure of their iniquity.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we may gather heereby, that pollitick order is not ouerthrown by the Doctrine of the Goſpell, neither is the right and authoritie of May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ouer their ſeruants abrogated by the faith of Chriſt. For <hi>Philemon</hi> was not an Infidell or vnbeleeuer, <note n="d" place="margin">Verſe 1.</note> but a fellow-helper with <hi>Paul;</hi> yet rule ouer his ſeruants is not denied him, nor taken from him, but hee is onely bidden to receiue him curteouſly, and to pardon him mercifully; yea <hi>Paule</hi> (as we ſee) doth humbly beſeech him, that hee may obtaine and retaine his former place, and doth not ſtraitly command him to diſcharge him of his ſeruice. This iuriſdiction ſtandeth by good warrant of the Lawes of God and Men: but of this wee haue ſpoken more at large before, in the 12. Verſe of this Epiſtle.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, we ſee the Title againe repeated, that he giueth to <hi>Philemon,</hi> when he calleth him by the name of his Brother. Thus he called him before verſe 7. and ſo he eſteemed of <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> verſe 16. VVhereby wee ſee, that all men made members of Chriſt, and engrafted into his body, are become as faith. Brethren one to another. Thus doth the Apoſtle call this <hi>Oneſimus</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Col. 4, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>A faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; a beloued Brother,</hi> who is as one of them that were chiefe in the church. The conſideration heereof, ought on the one ſide, to pull downe our proud Feathers, and make vs equall with them of the lower ſort: and on the other ſide, to make vs loue one another not with diſſimulation, but with brotherly loue; not in word onely, but in truth; as members of one body, and as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of one father.</p>
               <pb n="407" facs="tcp:7222:217" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Sixtly, he continueth his humble ſupplication for <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that they are farre from true repentance, that doe excuſe, or defend, or deny their faults and offences; <hi>For hee that</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Prou. 28, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>hideth his ſinnes ſhall not proſper, but he that confeſſeth and forſaketh them, ſhall finde Mercie.</hi> When <hi>Oneſimus</hi> did ſee ſo famous an Apoſtle of Chriſt, ſo carefully to intreate for his cauſe, he ought much more to be humbled with a feeling and remembrance of his former offences, thereby to mooue the minde of his Maiſter to gentleneſſe and moderation.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, obſerue out of this place, that albeit we doubt not to obtaine that which we deſire, but are aſſured to inioy that which we ask, yet we muſt deal earneſtly and effectually, both in regatd of the matter it ſelfe (for in a waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and neceſſary cauſe, we ought not to proceed ſlenderly) and in reſpect of the nature of men, who many times are dull to conceiue, and ſlow to graunt that which we craue. There is no man ſo quick of pace, but needeth to haue the ſpurres clapped to his ſides now and then. No man runneth ſo ſwift a pace, but ſometimes wanteth exhortations, conſolations, reprehenſions, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, threatnings, and ſuch like encoragements. We haue not yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vnto perfection, ſo long as we liue we muſt be Schollers in Chriſtes ſchoole, and as it were, proceed from ſtep to ſtep. Thus much breefly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the generall Obſeruations: Now, let vs come to the handling of the perticuler Doctrines.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">[<hi>Yea, Brother, let me obtaine this fruite.</hi>]</q> By this concluſion it may appear, that albeit <hi>Oneſimus</hi> had robbed his Maiſter, and run away with a great part of his ſubſtance, yet hee had ſpent all (as it often falleth out with ill-gotten goods) and then being beaten with his owne rod (as the <note n="k" place="margin">Luke 15, 17.</note> prodigall ſonne) and brought to neceſsity, taſted of the ſweete fruite of the Miniſtery of the bleſſed Apoſtle. Hence it is, that he vrgeth ſo earneſtly, and preſſeth <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſo exceedingly to remit the debt, &amp; to forgiue the hurt he had receiued by his naughty ſeruant, as being no way able to ſatisfy him, nor by any means heereafter being likely to ſatisfy him. For if any ability had bin in him, to make ſatisfaction, there had bin no place for pardon and remiſsion, nor for <hi>Paules</hi> vndertaking of the debt. If we by fraud and ſtealth, by iniury and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice, poſſeſſe the goods of other men, we are commanded to make actuall and reall reſtitution. The word of God teacheth vs directly, that ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the goods of other men, <note n="l" place="margin">Leuit. 6, 1, 7. Math. 5, 23, 24 Numb. 5, 6, 7.</note> are vnmeet for his worſhip, &amp; vnfit for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. Againe, ſuch as with-hold them from the right owners, <note n="m" place="margin">Eze. 18, 15, 33.</note> ſhall die in their ſins, and not haue pardon before reſtitution, when God hath enabled them thereunto. But if we do keep backe from them their owne, <note n="n" place="margin">

                  </note> our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is not conſcionable, but counterfet. Heerby it appeareth, that <hi>Oneſimus</hi> was not able to pay vnto his Maiſter ſuch things as he had taken away, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it had bin an vnreaſonable requeſt to haue a debt pardoned which might be reſtored. For that which any man doth vniuſtly detaine, is none of his, but that perſons from whom it is detained. So then, this being the poore ſeruants condition, that he had left nothing of all that which he had taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way (as commonly goods euilly gotten, are euilly ſpent) the Apoſtle cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth pardon. <note place="margin" type="runSum">

Then they ſayde; Wee will restore it, and will not require it of them, wee will doo as thou hast ſayde.</hi> Where wee ſee, the wonderfull care that this Gouernour of the people had, to haue the poore releeued, and to cauſe their caſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, and to moue the Rich to be beneficiall and bountifull vnto them. So then, it is a cleare point, that no man ought to bee ouer-haſty in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſuch Debts as are due vnto him from poore men, and ſuch as are in great neede.</p>

Compaſſion and Loue, are to bee extended towardes ſuch as craue fauour, and are willing, albeit not able to ſatisfie vs, according to their deſire, and our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund. This is the Reaſon which is pointed out vnto vs, in the parable propounded by our Sauiour, ann expreſſed by the Euangeliſt Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> in the 7. Chapter, and the 41. Verſe. <hi>A certaine Lender had two Debters; the one ought fiue hundered pence, and the other fifty; and when they had nothing to pay, hee forgaue them both.</hi> The like appeareth in another Parable menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in <hi>Mathew,</hi> Chapter 18, 24. <hi>When the Seruant was brought that ought to his Maister tenne thouſand Talents, becauſe he had nothing to pay, hee had compaſſion, and looſed him, and forgaue him that debt.</hi> Whereby wee ſee, that the cauſe why his Lord had compaſsion vpon him, was his inability and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, he was not able to pay.</p>

If then, our dooing good to others, bringeth profit to our ſelues, it is our duty to ſhewe to them our Compaſſion, in eaſing and mittigating ſuch burthens as otherwiſe wee might lay vppon them.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 3.</note> Thirdly, the example of God is to be ſet before vs: he forgiueth his poore
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:7222:218" rendition="simple:additions"/> Debters that are not able to pay him. We are al deepely indebted to God, we are deſperate debters, wee owe vnto him more then tenne thouſand Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, and haue nothing to ſatisfie the leaſt mite of that hee may require and challenge of vs. We are in an hard caſe, if God ſhould deale roughly and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly with vs. But when we cannot reſtore, he doth remit; &amp; when we are not ably to pay, he offereth pardon. This reaſon is vrged by <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 24, 17, 18. <hi>Thou ſhalt not peruert the right of the ſtraunger, nor of the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, nor take a Widdowes Rayment to pledge: but remember that thou wast a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant in Egipt, and how the Lord thy God deliuered thee thence.</hi> In which words, he mooueth them to ſhew mercy, becauſe they had receiued mercie; they had receiued it of God, they muſt returne it backe againe vnto their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.

Firſt, this ſerueth to teach vs, that men are not alwayes to looke to their owne benefit and profit, but likewiſe to the profite of others. Wee ſee by experience, that many are ſuch great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourers and Sea-gulphes, that they are neuer contented, but ſeeke to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vp all they can lay holde vppon: Theſe will remit nothing, releaſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, mittigate nothing. It is a woorthy precept giuen by the Apoſtle, <note n="x" place="margin">Phil. 2, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Looke not euerie man on his owne things, but euery man alſo on the things of other men.</hi> This is a fruite of true faith, <note n="y" place="margin">1 Cor. 13, 5.</note> and a ſigne of true loue, when we ſeeke to do good one to another. It is a bleſſed and comfortable thing vnto our owne hearts, to be content to leaue our owne, to depart from our right, and to ſuffer loſſe and damage. We heard before, how <hi>Nehemiah</hi> remedied the oppreſsion of the people, whereby he found as great comfort to himſelfe, as he brought comfort to them, ſo that he prayed, <note n="z" place="margin">Nehem. 5, 19</note> 
                  <hi>Remember me, (O my God) in goodneſſe, according to all that I haue done to this people.</hi> If we feele the ſame affection in our ſelues, wee ſhall finde the benefite thereof in our heartes. On the other ſide, it ſhall fall out to be a matter of great griefe and griping to out Conſciences, to remember how hard-hearted and hand-faſted, wee haue beene, euen when the Calamity of the times and the neceſsitie of our Brethren haue cryed out vnto vs for mercie.</p>
               <p>Wee may ſee a great number that lye in wait and ambuſhment, as skouts and eſpials, nay as Theeues and Robbers for their prey, who ſuck the blood of thetr poore Brethren out of their veines, and draw the Marrowe out of their bones. What perſons are to be releeued ſooner then the poore? And what times and ſeaſons are there to ſhew mercy, better then of Dearth and Famine? Yet then doe mercileſſe men (as Horſſe-Leaches) pull what they can from the poore, to enrich them-ſelues, albeit it bee with the ruine of others. They are glad of ſuch times, they are moſt welcome vnto them, whereas (in verie deede) they ſhoulde then eſpecially open their bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elles and breaſts to ſhew Compaſsion to ſuch as are in neceſsity. Their mindes are onely bent to enrich themſelues, they praiſe it as a faire and fat yeare for them-ſelues, albeit it bee a leane and lamentable yeare for all others. This is a moſt wretched deſire: this argueth a ſmall regard towardes the poore, which haue much adoe to maintaine them-ſelues, euen when they are helped and ſuccoured. Wee ſee how the prizes of all things encreaſe of Meat, of Drink, of Bread, of Houſes, of Lands, of Cattle,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:7222:219"/> and other Commodities: but the earnings and wages of poore folkes doe not encreaſe, but rather decreaſe, ſo that ſuch as haue beene able to liue and to maintaine their families in reaſonable ſort, are now driuen to begge, and go behinde hande, and liue by Almes. If in the generall riſing of all other things, if in the raiſing, or rather racking of Rents, if in the inhancing of the prizes of ſuch wares as the rich men haue to vtter, the hyre alſo of the Day-labourer were augmented and encreaſed, it would be more eaſie for them to maintaine an hard and poore life, and by the ſweat of their labour to keepe their Wife and Children. But this ſeemeth to be corrupt and vnconſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable dealing againſt the Lawe of God, againſt ciuill Equity, and common Humanity, and to threaten the decay of many mens eſtates, that all commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities ſhould alter to extraordinary prizes, and yet the poore haue only his ordinary allowance for the day, and bee made euen a common Drudge or Packhorſe, to beare the burthens of others vpon his backe. The Law of loue requireth, that the more we ſee any man diſtreſſed, ſo much the more wee ought to ſpare him, vntill he may recouer his eſtate. If we ſee him willing to paye vs, and grieued in himſelfe that hee cannot pay vs, and vſe all good meanes to his vtmoſt power to pay vs, let vs beare with him, and not ſhewe rigor toward him.

In like manner, when wee behold our poore Brother in great neceſſity, hauing much ado to maintaine himſelfe, and ſuſtaine his life, if we thruſt him downe altogether, how dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the loue of God in vs? Shal not his pouerty cry vnto him for vengeance? Let vs therefore beware of adding affliction to ſuch as are already in miſery, and know, that the ſparing of the poore, is an acceptable ſeruice &amp; ſacrifice vnto God, wherewith he is exceedingly well pleaſed.</p>

The rich man in the Goſpell, that ſuffered <hi>Lazarus</hi> to lye at his gate, without releefe and compaſſion, <note n="b" place="margin">Luke 16, 24.</note> would haue giuen an whole world (if hee had had it) for one droppe of water to coole his tongue that was tormented in that flame: but when he moſt of all wanted comfort, it was denied vnto him.

So his Lord was wroth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered him to the Tormenters, till he ſhould pay all that was due to him.</hi> It is laide to the charge of the Iewes, that notwithſtanding their outward profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ſhew of Religion, they were indeede irreligious and voide of true piety, in that they refuſed to ſhew mercy toward the poore. For the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> Chapt. 58, 3. or rather the Lord by the Prophet, ſaith; <hi>They will draw neere vnto God, ſaying; Wherefore haue wee Faſted, and thou ſeest it not? Wee

               </p>
               <p>Where the Prophet reproueth the hypocriſie of this people that gloried in the obſeruation of the Ceremonies, and yet they ſhewed no pitty to their Neighbours, but delighted rather to fleeſe and flawe them to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.

               <p>Hence it is, that the Prophet pronounceth him happy and bleſſed, that conſidereth wiſely, and thinketh charitably of ſuch as are in pouerty and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe; abilite, they want power to help them, albeit to releeue them, means to direct them, and counſel to comfort them; <note n="f" place="margin">Pſa. 41, 1, 2, 3</note>

Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame Law, is extreame wrong, and great cruelty: for euen the lawes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues require to be mitigated with equity, and tempered with reaſon; and ſeaſoned with conſcience.

The times and occaſions may be ſuch, as may make the ſeeking of our owne to be theft; yea, Murther; when it taketh away the Bread of the poore which is their liuing.</p>
               <p>We ſee, how the Prophet maketh it vnlawfull for all perſons at all times, to require all their debts of all ſorts of men. We ſee, that the Seruant in the Goſpell is puniſhed for requiring al his owne: he caſt his Fellow-ſeruant into Priſon by a warrant of Lawe, and a ſtrict courſe of Iuſtice; he exacted no more then was due vnto him; he required not two hundred pence, when an hundred onely would haue diſcharged the debt; yet himſelfe was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore throwne into vtter darkneſſe, where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth. For the times may be ſo hard, our Bretheren may be ſo poore, and we may be ſo wealthy, that we ought to be content to depart from our right, and to yeelde to the neceſſity of ſuch as are in want, and to ſay with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; <note n="g" place="margin">2 King. 5, 26</note> 
                  <hi>Is this a time to take Money, and to receiue Garments, and Oliues, and Vineyards, and Sheepe, and Oxen, and Men-Seruants, and Maid-Seruants?</hi> The creditor could ſay thus much for himſelf, &amp; lay this for his defence, that came to take away the Children of the poore Widdow to make them his Bond-men; He required but his owne.

                  <hi>Why rather ſuffer ye not wrong? Why rather ſustaine ye not harme?

It is a ſilly ſhift to ſay, I do nothing but that which Law warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth me: for we muſt alſo be able to ſay; I haue done nothing but that which a good conſcience hath warrented me; which equity hath warranted mee; which loue hath warranted me; and (that which is more then all the reſt) I haue doone nothing, but that which the profeſſion of the Goſpell of Chriſt
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:7222:220" rendition="simple:additions"/> hath warranted me. If we can ſay this truely, we haue comfort in God, and peace in our owne hearts. This is it which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh touching himſelfe, and his owne practiſe; <note n="i" place="margin">1 Cor. 9, 12.</note>

There be ſome, that vnder a colour of Religion, will cozen and deceiue, creeping into mens boſomes, borrowing and getting from them what they can, with a corrupt minde and a guilefull conſcience, and ſpending it in idleneſſe, in ryotouſneſſe, in drunkenneſſe, &amp; ſuch like leudneſſe.

Thus, while theſe men aske releefe, they thinke they require nothing but their owne, and that others are much indebted and greatly beholden vnto them, that they will take an almes at their handes. Others (who yet are more proud and prophane) do ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully abuſe, not onely the liberality of the rich, but the very word of God it ſelfe, framing it to ſerue their owne turne, and wreſting it to pleaſe their own humours, pretending that they <note n="k" place="margin">Luke 6, 35.</note>

               <p>Againe, the purpoſe of our Sauiour is to be conſidered, who in that place moueth vs to doe good one to another, with a ſingle eye, and with a ſimple heart; not to loue, becauſe we would be loued; nor to do pleaſure, becauſe we would receiue the like; but to loue euen our enemies, of whom we haue no kindneſſe againe. For in the wordes going before, he ſaith; <note n="l" place="margin">Luke 6, 32, 33, 34.</note> 
                  <hi>If yee loue them which loue you, what thanke ſhall ye haue? For euen the Sinners loue thoſe that loue them, &amp;c.

It ſtandeth not with the rule of Charitie, to giue away part of our goods with this condition, that hee pleaſure vs in the like with that which he hath. For theſe giue or lend nothing, but to thoſe of whom they hope to receiue the like; and therefore obey not the counſell of Chriſt, that would haue thoſe called and inuited to our Tables, which cannot bid vs againe, nor giue vs any recompence. So then, we muſt ſhew our ſelues willing to make the poor partakers of that we haue, although they be not able to doe the like for vs. This is it which our Sauiour meaneth <hi>By lending, and looking for nothing againe:</hi> And thus much touching the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 3.</note> Thirdlie, ſuch motions receiue a bleſsing from God.

If then any come vnto vs, and perſwade vs to turne vnto God, and to forſake our former waies: who are better, or greater, or ſurer Friends vnto vs then theſe? For who can wiſh vs greater good, or procure vs greater benefit, then to ſeeke to ſaue our ſoules, and to make vs inheritors of Gods Kingdome?

For it is a baſe and blinde excuſe, and a weake pretence, not to bee allowed; for a man, when he hath done euill, to confeſſe he did it for his friendes cauſe, or at his friendes requeſt. There is no man ſo cloſely tyed vnto any, that for their ſakes he ſhould ſubmit himſelfe to that which is euill, and ſo make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe partaker of their ſinnes.

Let vs therefore know, that God requireth of vs this dutie, to take diligent heed that we giue no conſent to euill, nor incline our hearts to obey thoſe that would prouoke vs vnto it. They are Inſtruments of the Deuill, that would draw vs to iniquitie, and pull vpon our owne heads, the heauy wrath and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of God: ſo that we ought as much to abhorre them, and to fly from them, as if we heard the Deuill himſelfe ſpeake vnto vs, and therefore to ſay vnto them; Come behinde mee Sathan, or auoyde Sathan, thou art an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence vnto me.</p>

What did the Wife of <hi>Potipher</hi> reſpect in her raging and burning luſt? Did ſhe reſpect the Couenant of GOD, or the credit of her Husband, or her owne honour or honeſtie? No, vncleaneneſſe had poſſeſſed her heart; Luſt carryed her eye; Impudencie ruled her tongue; and all partes of Soule and Bodie were out of order.

It is an euill thing, to make any euill motion; yea, albeit no euill follow after it, and albeit no conſent be giuen vnto it. It was euill in Sathan the Tempter, to tempt our Sauiour in the Wildernſſe; <note n="t" place="margin">Iohn 4, 46.</note> albeit hee found nothing in him, and could faſten no infidelitie, no preſumption, no ſinne vpon him. So is it in his Inſtruments, although they cannot preuaile to ſeduce any vnto ſinne, and draw them to offend God; yet they haue wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked hearts and intents, in laying ſnares and baites to intrap others. Wee ſee this in <hi>Ioſephes</hi> vnchaſt Miſtreſſe, albeit ſhee could not draw away his heart from the feare of God, nor weaken the Faith hee had in him, yet her ſinne was not the leſſe, nor her purpoſe any whit the better.

                  <hi>If it pleaſe the King, let it be written that the Iewes may be destroyed.</hi> Now albeit the Church was deliuered, yet his mallice was inſatiable, and in the ende turned to his owne deſtruction. This ought to terrifie all graceleſſe Suppliants, that make no choyce or conſcience what they demaund: for when they are not carefull to deſire ſuch thinges as are warrantable and conſonant to the will and heauenly pleaſure of God, their owne requeſtes doe many times in the iuſt iudgement of God, turne to their owne confuſion. Wherefore it ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all men vpon, to looke with a ſingle eye into the cauſe which they mind, before they ſeeke it, and ſue for it; that it be iuſt, reaſonable, conſcionable and honeſt: againſt ſuch, as neuer haue in themſelues ſuch conſideration, but ſo they may ſpeede in their purpoſe, they regard not what they deſire. This is a point worthy to be marked of all, eſpecially of thoſe that depend vpon
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:7222:223" rendition="simple:additions"/> others to be aduanced and preferred. It is a greeuous ſinne to abuſe the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and authority of others, to bring their bad and leud purpoſes to paſſe. It is the manner of many men that are in credit with great perſons, to be bold to ſollicite any of them without difference or due regard of equitie; not conſidering the lawfulneſſe or vnlawfulneſſe of the thing; the making or marring of others; the doing of good vnto them, or the vtter vndoing of them.

                  <hi>That he alſo hath a Maiſter in heauen.</hi> The Father muſt conſider that he alſo hath a Father which is in Heauen.

Whatſoeuer they are commaunded to do, can bind the conſcience no farther then ſtandeth with the pleaſure of God. It is not enough for them to ſay; I was moued to it by others; I was commanded to do it; it lay not in my power to preuent it or reſiſt it; I am vnder the iuriſdiction of others, and am tyed to obey. This will not goe for currant payment, but beareth a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit ſtampe; it is like the Figge-leaues of <hi>Adam</hi> where-with he couered himſelfe, which ſerued his turne well enough, vntill God came to examine him, and to enter into iudgement with him. So theſe weake excuſes, ſeeme wiſe reaſons to iuſtifie our wicked obedience, vntill they come to be ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and ſifted by the light of Gods word. For this cauſe the Apoſtle tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ſubiection to Parents, ſaith; <note n="z" place="margin">Ephe. 6. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Children, obey your Parents in the Lord, for this is right.</hi> Whereby we learne, how to vnderſtand that precept which ſeemeth to exact a generall or vniuerſall obedience, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Children, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey your Parents in all thinges;</hi> namely, that it muſt be in good and lawfull things.</p>
               <p>In like manner, as the obedience of Inferiours is inſtinted and reſtrained, not left at randome and at libertie; ſo the iuriſdiction of ſuch as are in Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour places, is not ſo great, as to tyrannize ouer mens conſciences, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what they pleaſe, and to commaund what ſeemeth good in their own eies; but it muſt know the bounds that God hath appointed, and not exceede the ſame. This made the Apoſtle ſay to the Church of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 11, 1</note> 
                  <hi>Be ye followers of me, as I am of Chriſt.</hi> He chargeth them to goe no farther with him, then they ſaw him to walke with Chriſt; and therefore in another place he ſheweth, <note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 1, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>That if any Man or any Angell from Heauen ſhould Preach otherwiſe then they had receiued, he must be holden accurſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſerueth to reprooue all ſuch as binde their Inferiours to doe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they commaund. This is to ſet vppe our ſelues in ſtead of GOD. Abſolute obedience in all thinges without reſtraint is due to none, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that hath an abſolute power and commaund ouer all Creatures. His authoritie is infinite, and receiueth no limitation. As for the Sonnes of men, how great ſoeuer their power be; yet it is finite, and it vrgeth vs no farther, then they haue warrant to commaund vs.</p>
               <pb n="420" facs="tcp:7222:224" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Wherefore, they are greatly deceiued, and take too much vpon them, that thinke themſelues abuſed, their places contemned, and their authority di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, when they are not in all things obeyed. Nay, they themſelues doe not ſufficiently know themſelues, nor their high callings, that looke for more then is due vnto them, and require of their Inferiours, ſo much as they with a good conſcience cannot performe. Theſe are they that ſay; Doe they not owe vs a dutie? Are they not vnder vs? Haue not wee power ouer them? May not we commaund ſubiection and obedience vnto vs? True it is, all reuerence and obedience is due vnto them in the Lorde; but if they will haue ſubiection againſt the Lord, and againſt his will, they forget their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they take too much vppon them, and they vſurpe a Dominion that was neuer committed and communicated vnto them. Let all that are in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, beware of this pride of hart, and aduancing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues aboue that which ought to be in them.</p>
               <p>This we ſee to haue beene in <hi>Saule,</hi> as he perſecuted <hi>Dauid</hi> from place to place, ſo he commaunded <note n="c" place="margin">1 Sam. 22, 17</note> the Sergeants that ſtood about him, <hi>To turne and ſlay the Priestes of the Lorde;</hi> as if they were bound to doe it at his deſire. The like appeareth in <hi>Abſalom,</hi> when he would ſatisfie his owne mallice, and reuenge the diſhonour done to his Siſter <hi>Tamar,</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="margin">2 Sam. 13, 28</note> he commaunded his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, ſaying; <hi>Marke now when Amnons heart is merry with Wine, and when I ſay vnto you; Smite Amnon; kill him, feare not, for haue not I commaunded you? Be bold therefore, and play the Men.</hi> He doth not goe about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade their conſciences of the lawfulneſſe of the fact, but he is blinde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and ſeeketh to blinde the eyes of other; he is carried away with mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and filleth the handes of others with blood. Thus are the wicked poſſeſſed with pride, and preſume in the height of their iniquity, that all their vngodly commaundements whatſoeuer, are to be obeyed. But as they are reprooued that execute whatſoeuer they are required to doe; ſo are they reprehended, that will require euery thing that they liſt, to glut their owne anger and mallice. They that do commaund, and ſuch as are commaunded, are both culpable of iudgement. <hi>Saul,</hi> in commaunding to ſlay the Prieſtes of the Lord, was an horrible Murtherer; ſo was alſo <hi>Doeg,</hi> the Executioner of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abſalom</hi> charging his Seruants to kill his Brother, was a deteſtible Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide; ſo alſo the Seruants had their handes defiled with blood that obeyed his commaundement. Let vs therefore all of vs remember the rule of the Apoſtle. 2 Cor. 13. 8. <note n="e" place="margin">2 Cor. 13, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>We cannot doe any thing against the truth, but for the truth:</hi> So let all Superiors ſay; We can commaund nothing againſt the Lord, but for the Lord. And let all Inferiours ſay; we cannot obey againſt the Lord, but in the Lord; and whether it be better to obey God or Man, iudge you. We muſt all conſider, before we require obedience, what it is that wee would haue done, that we may haue warrant to exact it; and others comfort to execute it.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">[<hi>Refreſh my Bowels in the Lord.</hi>]</q> This is another variable phraſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Apoſtle requireth, that <hi>Oneſimus</hi> be receiued againe into his Maiſters ſeruice.

For how ſhall we reioyce and be glad at their good, if we be not carefull to know in what ſtate they are, and how they fare? This dutie wee may ſee practiſed in the holie Scriptures; by <hi>Abraham, Lot, Nehemiah, Dauid,</hi> and diuers others, who were both carefull to ſuccour and releeue ſuch as were in diſtreſſe, and watchfull to informe themſelues of the wantes and neceſſities of their Bretheren. And thus wee may ſee how one Church
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:7222:225"/> prouideth for another, as the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> 
                  <note n="q" place="margin">2 Cor. 8, &amp; 9.</note> 
                  <hi>for the poore afflicted Members of Christ that were at Ieruſalem.</hi> This reproueth ſuch, as albeit they ſee the troubles of the Church with their eies, and heare the complaint of the poore with their eares, yet ſhut their eyes, and ſtop their eares, and paſſe by them, as the Prieſt and Leuite did, when they ſaw him that fell vpon Theeues lie wounded and halfe dead. Theſe ſhal finde as little mercy at the hands of God, as they ſhew to their afflicted and diſtreſſed brethren. If then we would find mercie in time of need, let vs ſhew mercy and comfort in the time of calamity, when our Friends, our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, our Kindred are in trouble. And albeit we neuer ſee our Bretheren lie in their affliction, nor ouer-whelmed with ſorrow, that we ſhould ſuccor them, yet are we not thereby iuſtified and diſcharged, vnleſſe wee alſo haue bin carefull to enquire of others how they do, what they want, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſtand in neede of our helpe. It is recorded of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> that while they offered their ſeruice to entertaine ſtrangers, <note n="r" place="margin">Ge. 18, &amp; 19 Heb. 13, 2, 3.

When <hi>Nehemiah</hi> met with ſome of his Brethren that came from <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> he tarried not vntill they made relation of the eſtate of the Church, to teſtifie his zeale to Gods worſhippe, his loue to the poore Saints, his deſire of the proſperity of the faithfull, but hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented them, and asked earneſtly of their welfare. Thus did <hi>Dauid</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the kindneſſe betweene him and <hi>Ionathan,</hi> and forgat not to ſhewe it to his poſterity, and to the houſe of <hi>Saule:</hi> and albeit hee had dealt graciouſly and mercifully with many, yet he called for more, and left none of them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded.</p>
               <p>Let this affection rule in vs, and draw out of vs this teſtimony of a louing heart. Many there are, that will ſeeme to bee friends of the Church, and to regard the good thereof, and when helpe is craued of them, will not bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind hand to deale liberally toward the releeuing therof. This is a good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and a commendable vertue which is to be cherriſhed in them, for there are hundreds and thouſands that neuer come ſo farre, nor proceede to this ſteppe, but declare themſelues either open enemies, or ſenceleſſe <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> that looke onely to them-ſelues, but haue no feeling of the eſtate of others. Neuertheleſſe, if God haue giuen vnto vs a bountifull hand, wee muſt not reſt there, and ſtand at a ſtay, wee muſt learne a farther leſſon, and aſcend vp higher, and ſhew more loue to the Church, then to giue to them that aske, and to ſuccour ſuch as we ſee in neceſſity; for we muſt giue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a farther duty, euen vſe our tongues that God hath giuen vs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our ſelues in the knowledge of their condition that we ſee not, that are abſent from vs, that are vnknowne vnto vs. We ſee how deſirous and greedy men are of newes, and to enquire of Trauellers the eſtate of places and perſons, that they may ſeeme to bee ignoraunt of nothing: and in this they are very <hi>Athenians,</hi> 
                  <note n="ſ" place="margin">Acts 17, 21.</note> who gaue themſelues to nothing elſe, but eyther to tell, or to heare ſome newes. But this deſire of nouelty, argueth the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of our minds, or ſerueth to the delight of the outwarde man, or at the fartheſt bringeth with it onely a momentary pleaſure, and ſlender profite. If we would know ſuch newes as may delight our ſelues and others, and bring great pleaſure, and greater profit both to our ſelues and others, let vs inquire how the poore people of God do, let vs aske of their welfare, let vs vſe all meanes to know their eſtate; this ſhall be well pleaſing to God, comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our ſelues, profitable to the Church, and auayleable to ſtir vp others to follow our example.</p>

                  </note> cuſtome for men to celebtate and ſolemnize their birth day, the day wherein they were borne and brought forth into the world: and we haue one example of it in the Goſpell, of <hi>Herod,</hi> 
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Math. 14, 6. Marke 6, 21,</note> who <hi>when his birth day was kept, made a Banquet to his Princes and Captaines, and chiefe estates of Galile.</hi> If this were vſed among the Heathen, to retaine in memory the remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of that time, wherein it was ſaide, <hi>A Man-child is borne into the world,</hi> how much more ought we that are Chriſtians, to make the day of our new byrth, a day of ioy and gladneſſe, a day of mirth and delight, a day of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and reioyſing in the Lord, wherein we haue beene borne againe, and made the Children of God. For the firſt birth is vnto death; the ſecond, is vnto life. The firſt birth giueth vs a being; the ſecond, giueth vs a good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in God; the firſt birth is to condemnation, the ſecond birth is to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By the firſt birth we are made the veſſels of wrath; by the ſecond, wee are made the heyres of the heauenly kingdome. The firſt birth <note n="u" place="margin">Ezek. 16. 1, 2</note> is in vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; the ſecond birth is in righteouſneſſe, and in true holineſſe. By the firſt birth, we beare the Image of the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> by the ſecond, wee beare the Image of Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> By the firſt birth, we can do nothing but euill, <note n="x" place="margin">Gen. 6, 5.</note> inaſmuch as the immaginations of the thoughts of our heartes, are onely euill continually; by the ſecond birth, we are enabled and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened by the ſpirit to do good, and to walke in the wayes of God that are well pleaſing in his ſight; ſo that this ought to bee much more eſteemed of vs, then the former, and to comfort vs aboue all thinges and times in the world. We ſee this in the example of <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Luke 19, 6.</note> who at his newe birth was comforted exceedingly, he receiued Chriſt Ieſus ioyfully, he acknowledged him as the Father that begat him willingly: hee made a great feaſt for glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and gaue great guifts to the poore, with al alacrity. The like appeareth in the Iaylor, recorded in the Acts of the Apoſtles, <note n="z" place="margin">Acts. 16, 32, 33.</note> 
                  <hi>Who being conuerted, at the ſame time he tooke his two Fathers, Paule &amp; Silas, and waſhed their wounds; he ſet meat before them, &amp; reioyſed greatly with all his houſhold.</hi> We ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to know them that haue begotten vs in the Lord, and haue bin Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our conuerſion.</p>
               <p>Theſe examples ſerue as a reproofe againſt thoſe, that neuer had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge either of the time when, or of the place where, or of the maner how, or of the perſon by whom they were conuerted and begotten againe as new borne babes in Chriſt; that neuer had the feeling of this grace of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This is a wretched condition, and a fearfull ſigne, that they ſauour ſtil of the fleſh, and lie in the corruptions of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> and knowe not what a ſecond birth meaneth. Thus it was with <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Iohn 3, 1, 3, 4</note> a man of the Phariſies, a Ruler of the Iewes, and a Teacher of Iſrael, when Chriſt had taught him, <hi>That except a Man be borne againe, he cannot ſee the Kingdome of God,</hi> hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>How can a man be borne which is olde?

If there bee a good vſe of this, much more benefit and comfort ſhal we find by the recording of our ſecond birth, of our life in God, and our dying to ſinne, by remembering the time, the place, the party, &amp; other ſuch like circumſtances, to the euerlaſting peace of our owne Conſciences, by whom we haue beene brought to this life.

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 4.</note> Laſtly, ſeeing we are to reioyce at the good of our brethren, wee muſt from hence be drawn to an higher and farther duty; Namely, to giue thanks to God for them, as for the bleſsings beſtowed vpon our ſelues. It is our duty to craue of God ſuch thinges as they want, and to giue him the praiſe for ſuch things as he hath beſtowed vpon them. Our ioy muſt not be carnal, but our reioyſing muſt be in the Lord. If then we order our ioy and gladneſſe aright, it will lift vs vp to behold and conſider from whence al good things proceed. We oftentimes receiue at the hands of God many good guifts, but neuer remember to returne vnto him the praiſe. So it falleth out, that diuers will ſeeme ioyful and glad at the proſperity and happineſſe of their brethren, who neuertheleſſe are tongue-tied, &amp; neuer open their mouths to giue glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the giuer and granter of them. We muſt therefore know, that it is our duty to render thankes to God for his benefits vouchſafed to his people. And this is a notable ſigne and token whereby we may try and examine what our mirth and gladneſſe is, and whether it bee rightly ordered and diſpoſed, or not. If it be Spirituall, and not Carnall; Holy, and not Prophane; Heauenly, and not Worldly; it will ſtirre vs vp to caſt vp our eyes and hearts to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lights, acknowledging al to come from the ſeat of his holineſſe. The Apoſtle directing the Church what their ioy ought to be, ſaith, <hi>Phillip.</hi> 4, 4. <hi>Reioyce in the Lord alwaies, againe I ſay reioyce.</hi> This vſe which now wee vrge of this Doctrine, is expreſſely confirmed and concluded in the practiſe of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thro,</hi> as we ſee, Exod. 18, 10, 11. before remembred vnto vs: ſo ſoone as he had teſtified his reioyſing; at all the goodneſſe which the Lorde had ſhewed to <hi>Iſraell,</hi> immediately he ſaide, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord, who hath deliuered you out of the hand of the Egiptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh: who hath alſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the people from vnder the hand of the</hi> Egyptians: <hi>now I knowe, that the Lord is greater then all the Gods, for as they haue dealt proudly with them, ſo are they recompenſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> declareth, that the great workes and wonders that God had ſhewed to <hi>Iſraell,</hi> wrought great ioy of heart in <hi>Iethro</hi> his Father in Lawe; but he reſted not there, nor ſtayed in an outward reioyſing; his ioy did end in thankeſgiuing, which ſanctifieth all our mirth and gladneſſe. For if our mouths be filled with laughter, and our tongue with ioy, and yet God bee ſhut out of our minds, there is nothing in vs, but pride and prophanneſſe of hart. Then is our mirth true mirth; and our ioyfulneſſe true gladneſſe; when God is al in all, when we acknowledge him to bee the author of it. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the people, <note n="b" place="margin">Pſ. 126, 1, 2, 3</note> when God brought againe the captiuity of <hi>Syon, They were like them that dreame, and became very ioyfull: Then ſaid they among the Heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them; the Lord hath done great things for vs, whereof we reioyce.</hi> Where we ſee, that their ioy of heart was accompanied with giuing of thankes. The like wee might ſay of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedek</hi> King of <hi>Shalem,</hi> and Prieſt of the moſt high God, who met <hi>Abraham</hi> returning from the ſlaughter of the Kinges, and bleſſed him, ſaying; <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 14, 19.</note>

The end of this ioy is heauineſſe. It is the faithful onely that are of God in Chriſt Ieſus, that can truly reioyce and be merrie from the heart: as for the ioy of others, it is but from the teeth and tongue outwardly, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not from the inward parts.

This appeareth to haue beene in <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> towards his Children, when they had ſold their Brother, and dipped his Coate in a Kids blood, and brought it to their Father. Albeit he knew they hated <hi>Ioſeph</hi> whome he loued exceedingly, yet hee would not ſuſpect them for the murthering and making away of his Sonne, but ſaide; Gen. 37, 33. <hi>It is my ſonnes Coate, a wicked Beast hath deuoured him, Ioſeph is ſurely torne in peeces.</hi> The like appeareth in <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> who was betrothed to <hi>Marie</hi> the Mother of Chriſt, when he ſaw that ſhe was with Childe, <note n="d" place="margin">Math. 1, 19</note> hee concluded rather, that it was by committing Fornication before the contract, then by committing adultry after her betroathing. When the matter was vncertaine and vnknowne vnto him, he iudged the beſt. Thus dealt <hi>Ionathan,</hi> who was faithfull toward <hi>Dauid,</hi> he perſwaded himſelfe and his friend the beſt of his Father. For when <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid, <note n="e" place="margin">1 Sa. 20, 1, 2</note>

The beſt man doth hardly ſuſpect others to bee bad. It is ſaide of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> Math. 1, 19. that being a iuſt and righteous man, he was not willing to make the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> that was betrothed vnto him a publicke example, but was minded to put her away ſecretly. Whereby we gather, that the reaſon why he would not purſue his right with extreamity, but conceyued the beſt according to the rule of Charity, was, becauſe hee was a iuſt man, ready to giue to euerie man his owne. On the other ſide, it is a note of a wicked man, to thinke or immagine the worſt of men. It is a common Prouerbe, <hi>A man doth muſe, as he doth vſe;</hi> as himſelfe, vſeth to do, ſo he immagineth of another. He that iudgeth lewdly of another, by meere ſuſpition or ſuppoſition, is commonly lewd himſelfe. For ſuch as are wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, do thinke others as wicked as them-ſelues: and ſuch as are Hypocrites themſelues, are moſt forward to tax others of hypocriſie. Seeing therefore, to be charitably minded, is both a property of loue, and a fruit of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; it followeth, that we ought to hope the beſt of all our brethren.</p>

Firſt, this ſerueth to reproue ſundrie abuſes that are crept in among vs, and are too common in our practiſe, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly condemned in the ninth Commaundement; which tend to the hurt of our Brothers good name, as all hard conceits and euill ſurmizes, all vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable opinions, and ſuſpitions, againſt them. The good name of a man is very precious, yet it hath many enemies. If then we be charged to conceiue the beſt in doubtfull caſes one of another, the capitall ſinne of Calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ſlander, is heerby condemned, as the chiefe oppoſite to a mans eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and credit. This hath many branches, that are breaches of the Law: all of one kinde and Kindred, and all enemies vnto the good Names of our Bretheren. In this number are ranged theſe three, as Companions one of another: the Tale-breeder, the Tale-bearer, and the Tale belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</p>
               <p>The firſt beginner of all the miſchiefe, is the Inuenter and Deuiſer of Tales, who forgeth them in the fire of hell, who hammereth them vpon the A nuile of malice and enuy, who venteth them abroad, and letteth them flye vpon the wings of fame and report, thereby maliciouſly intending the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and damage of his Brother.

Theſe men the Lord doth greatly deteſt, and wil ſhut them out of his kingdome.</p>
               <p>Secondly, heereby is reprooued the Tale-carrier; the former Merchant bringeth in the wares, this man is as a Pedler to vtter the wares, and to ſet them to ſale. And thus the Scripture it ſelfe ſpeaketh of theſe broachers and bringers of them, as <hi>Leuit.</hi> 19. 16. <hi>Thou ſhalt not Merchandize tales, or walke about with Tales among thy people.</hi> This ſort of men is not ydle, but is alwaies ſtirring vp and downe; they ſit not at home, but frequent many places; they are not ſtrangers, and vnknowne abroad, but are acquainted with many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and wil inſinuate themſelues into their company. It is a notable Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor that the ſpirit of God vſeth, to compare them to Pedlers, or petty-chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. We ſee what the Trade and faſhion of Pedlers is, ſo ſoon as they haue bought their wares of ſome one or moe Merchants, they ſel the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to others. Thus it is with Backbyters and Tale-bearers; when they haue gathered together a fardle of tales, of rumors, and reports; as it were with a packe of Wares, they wander from one place to another, from one houſe to another, from one perſon to another, that they may ſet out to ſale ſuch ſtuffe as they haue heard, and vtter them in the abſence of their Neighbor, to his diſgrace and infamy. Theſe are they, which encreaſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred among enemies, and make diſcord among the beſt Friends. Hence it is,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:7222:228" rendition="simple:additions"/> that <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <note n="i" place="margin">Prou. 26, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a Tale-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſtrife ceaſeth.</hi> Such perſons are the very plagues and poyſon of humaine ſociety, they wound a man in his good name, they rob him of his goodes, they wrong him in his friends, they bereaue him of his life. This we ſee in the example of <hi>Doeg</hi> the <hi>Edomite,</hi> who cauſed the Prieſts of the Lord to be ſlaine: of <hi>Ziba</hi> the falſe and vnfaithful ſeruant of <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> who by ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his Maiſter, obtained his goodes. It is a great iniury to rob a man of his goods, it is an heynous Theft in the ſight of God: it is a greater iniury to ſpoile a man of his good name, which is ſweeter then Oyntments, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Riches; for that which is ſtolne may be reſtored, but the blot of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy is hardly or neuer wiped away. There is ſome remedy againſt the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Serpents, mad Dogges, and venemous beaſts; but againſt the toong of the ſlanderer &amp; Sycophant, there can none be found. We ſee that theeues (who come to ſpoyle and to ſteale) may be preuented or ſhunned, but who can ſtand before the tongues and tales of the Tale-bearer? But it is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt iniury to bereaue a man of his life; which the ſlanderer doth oftentimes, by ſowing diſcord betweene party and party, as we ſhewed before in <hi>Doeg,</hi> of whome the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> complaineth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52, 2, 4. <hi>That his Tongue did cut like a ſharpe Razor, and that hee loued all wordes that may destroy.</hi> They are pronounced happy by the mouth of Chriſt <note n="k" place="margin">Math. 5, 9.</note> that are peace-makers; are not they therefore to be holden accurſed, that ſow hatred among frends, as it were Darnell in the fields; that are Make-bates and pick-thankes, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to pleaſe the fanſies of others? If then, the makers of peace be the ſons of God; ſurely Tale-bearers, that are makers of debate, are the Children of the Deuill, whoſe Image they beare. Theſe are the Deuils Merchants, and carry about with them his wares; they are his Apprentiſes or Iourny-men, and ſerue him for wages. And albeit they ſet vp one Trade, yet they ſell not after one faſhion. Some come whiſpering and leaſting ſecretly to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of others; ſome come glozing and peruerting the words that they vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, contrary to their meaning; ſome haue no ſooner ſolde their commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that they carry into one place, but they ſtore themſelues by and by with new. For, as they ſpeake to vs of other men freely, and fully, and falſely; ſo they will ſpeake as largely and lewdly of vs, to other men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, heere is condemned another enemy of our name and credit, to wit; he that loueth, beleeueth, and entertaineth lies and ſlanders. Theſe are ſuch, as deale not toward others, as they would haue others deal with them. This ſinne is reproued in the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23, 1. <hi>Thou ſhalt not receyue a falſe Tale, neither ſhalt thou put thine hand with the wicked, to be a falſe witneſſe.</hi> This the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> teacheth. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15, 3. <hi>He that ſlandereth not with his tongue, nor doth euill to his Neighbor, nor receiueth a falſe report against his neighbour, ſhall dwell in the Lords Tabernacle, and rest in his holy hill.</hi> But on the contrary, ſuch as ſlander, and defame, and receiue, and beleeue falſe tales, are deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp to Satan, and are heires of hell. In theft we ſee, that ſuch as receyue ſtolne goods, are acceſſary to the theft; ſo he that willingly heareth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth the reports of whiſperers, is guilty of the crime of back-byting. For it is a true ſaying; If there were no Tale-inuenter, there would be no Tale-receiuer; and if there were no Tale-receiuer, there would bee no Tale-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. Againſt all theſe Maladies and Miſchiefes, an approued and often tried Medicine, is true Charity; for if there bee in vs a Charitable Minde, a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Tongue, a Charitable Eare, a Charitable Heart, wee ſhall bee ſafe from theſe euilles. Where there is a Charitable Minde, there will bee no deuiſing and inuenting of ſlanders. Where there is a Charitable Tongue, there will bee no carting and carrying of falſe reports. Where there is a Charitable Eare, there will be no hearing of euill ſurmiſes one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; And where there is a Charitable Heart, there will be no beleeuing of
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:7222:228" rendition="simple:additions"/> them. Many attaine to the firſt ſtep, they haue a Charitable Mind, they wil inuent and forge no tales; but they miſſe in the ſecond, they want a Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table tongue; for when they haue heard falſe tales, they carry them about from one to another, and by that meanes the miſchiefe ſpreadeth farther: But many do come to theſe two firſt ſteppes, and yet faile in the third; they haue Charitable Minds and Tongues, they will deuiſe nothing, they will diſperſe nothing, yet they want a Charitable Eare, becauſe they take delight to heare falſe tales, and to haue them brought vnto them. It behooueth vs to watch ouer our Eares, as well as our Tongues; and conſider, that if we did not deſire to heare them, others would not long take delight to report them.</p>

Wee muſt not be ſuſpitious without great cauſe or good grounde, but to giue all vncertaine and wandering re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of our brethren, the beſt Interpretation, according to the rule before remembred, <note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 13, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Loue beleeueth all things, it hopeth all things.</hi> True it is, we ought not to be ouer-credulous and light of beleefe, to credite all things that are brought vnto vs, as <hi>Dauid</hi> was when he entertained &amp; beleeued falſe <hi>Ziba</hi> againſt his faithful ſubiect. Neither ought we to be hard of beleef, to belieue nothing that is told vs, though neuer ſo conſtantly and certainly, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in <hi>Gedaliah,</hi> who would not beleeue <note n="m" place="margin">Ier. 40, 14, 16.</note>

But this his want of beleefe, he bought with the loſſe of his owne life. Againe, as we are to conſtrue things in the beſt ſenſe, and beware that we wreſt nothing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the meaning of the ſpeaker, conſidering that they are heinous ſinners, that <note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 1, 29.</note> take al things in the worſe part: ſo we are alſo bound to ſhew a louing heart, a tender affection, and a Charitable compaſſion toward our brethren, in ſeeking to defend and maintaine his good name, when we hear him ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and his good name impaired. If we heare a malicious enemy broach his malice, by ſpeaking lies, and vttering ſlanders againſt our brethren, ought not we as their friends, in loue to open our mouths in the cauſe of the dumb, ſhewing our diſlike of their euill reportes, and teſtifying our good affection toward their perſons, and relating the truth in their defence? For wee muſt know, that we may be ſlanderers as well by ſilence, and holding our peace, as by diſcrediting them by our tongues. He is a falſe witneſſe, that hearing his neighbor falſely accuſed, doth not labour to cleare him, when he is able by giuing Teſtimony vnto the truth.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Ionathan</hi> by his owne knowledge, perceiued that the reports were falſe which flatterers had deuiſed, and <hi>Saule</hi> had immagined againſt <hi>Dauid,</hi> (being then miſled and miſinformed) he could not holde his tongue, <note n="o" place="margin">1 Sa. 20, 32.</note> but ſpake in his defence, in the cauſe of the innocent, ſaying; <hi>Wherefore ſhall hee die?

                  <hi>Doth our Law iudge a man before it heare him, and know what hee hath done?</hi> This ought to be an example vnto vs, how to behaue our ſelues, when wee heare good and godly men reuiled and rayled vpon, wrongfully accuſed, and vniuſtly ſlandered, we ſhould not be tongue-tied, but open our mouthes in their defence. It is a firme teſtimony of our loue both to their perſon &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Laſtly, we are to ſhew the griefe &amp; ſorrow which we conceiue, when ſoeuer we heare a true report of any faults and ſins committed by them that haue bin a blot and blemiſh vnto him. We ſee this <note n="q" place="margin">Nehemiah 5 Eſra 9. Phillip. 3.</note> in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> in <hi>Ezra,</hi> in <hi>Paul,</hi> and many others. So then, ſuch as are ready to iudge the beſt of their brethren, wil be careful to make the beſt of euery thing, to defend their good

                  </gap>. Heereby we ſhall ſaue a ſoule, cleare their good name, and couer a multitude of ſinnes. For it is moſt certaine, we can neuer conceiue a good Opinion of them, nor haue them in any eſtimation, nor entertaine a Charitable Iudgement of their dooings, vnleſſe wee ſhew our ſelues forward to exhort and admoniſh them, when wee ſee they walke not with a right foote, nor tread in the ſteppes that leade vnto eternall life. When <hi>Paule</hi> ſawe <hi>Peter</hi> diſſemble with the <hi>Iewes,</hi> he <note n="r" place="margin">Galat. 2, 14.</note> reprooued him to his face: ſo did <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> after hee had ſinned.</p>
               <p>It is a witneſſe infallible of our loue, in that we admoniſh our Bretheren, and ſuffer not ſinne vpon them. It ſhall bee a precious balme, that ſhall not breake their heads. On the other ſide, as we are to iudge the beſt of others; and to admoniſh thoſe that fall and offend: ſo we ought not to thinke that they hate vs that ſhew vs our faultes, or that they are our enemies that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue vs. A ſharpe reproofe, is more hardly digeſted, then a bitter pill is ſwallowed. We deſire for the moſt part to be ſoothed and flattered in our ſinnes, and to haue ſoft pillowes ſowed vnto our Elbowes, that we may ſleep in ſinne, without controulment, and ſo runne into deſtruction without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and with much eaſe. Neuer were there more miſerable times then theſe ate, in the which wee liue. Hee that reprooueth, maketh himſelfe a prey: and he that is reprooued, ſtormeth and rageth at the matter, as if hee had receiued a great iniurie, and as if men had gone beyond the bounds of their Calling. But if there be true Wiſedome in vs, wee muſt regard thoſe that do admoniſh vs in the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe.</hi> 4</note> Laſtly, ſeeing it is our duty to hope and eſteeme the beſt one of another, let this be acknowledged and confeſſed of vs, that we muſt iudge of no man before the time; we muſt take heed of raſh iudgement, according to the rule of Chriſt, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Math. 7, 1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Iudge not, that ye be not iudged; for with what Iudgement yee Iudge, ye ſhall be iudged: and with what meaſuee you mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</hi> Likewiſe our Sauiour in the parable of the Houſholder, which went out at the dawning of the day to hire Laborers into his Vineyard, ſignifieth, <hi>That God calleth at all houres and times of the day; ſome at one time, and ſome at another, according to the good pleaſure of his owne will.</hi> We muſt deſpaire of no mans ſaluation, but hope the beſt of them, that God will giue them repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to come out of the ſnares and ſubtleties of the Deuill, whereby they are holden captiues to do his will.</p>
               <p>This offereth vnto vs theſe three Meditations. Firſt, it is a comfort to thoſe that at the laſt are brought to repentance. No man is excluded from grace in this life, and from glory in the life to come, that turneth vnto God with all his heart. The Theefe vpon the croſſe was receiued to mercy: they that were called at the eleuenth houre, and laboured but one houre, had their peny. It falleth out oftentimes, <note n="t" place="margin">Math 19, 30. and 20, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>That the laſt are firſt, &amp; the firſt are laſt.</hi> Let none de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire through the greatneſſe, hainouſneſſe, and multitude of his ſins, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make haſt, &amp; delay not the time, to put off from day to day, conſidering how ready the Lord is to imbrace him, to receiue him, to forgiue him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, albeit the gate of mercy be ſet wide open for all penitent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yet this ought not to harden mens hearts in careleſneſſe and ſecuritie. For the vngodly that continue in their ſins, haue no defence for themſelues and their preſumption in Gods Mercie, by the example of thoſe that were called at the laſt houre of the day. Marke, that ſo ſoone as the theefe and Laborers were called, <note n="u" place="margin">Math. 20. 7.</note> by &amp; by they repented: the reaſon why they turned
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:7222:229" rendition="simple:additions"/> from their ſinnes no ſooner, was, becauſe grace was no ſooner offered vnto them: but when God ſpake, they heard his voice; when God called, they anſweared without delay: whereas theſe impenitent perſons haue had the meanes oftentimes offered vnto them, and yet refuſe the calling of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we are to hope the beſt of our brethren, to commend them vnto God, to pray for their conuerſion. There cannot be a greater iniury done vnto them, then to paſſe the ſentence of condemnation vpon them, and as much as lieth in vs, to blot them out of the booke of Life. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. Cor. 4. <note n="x" place="margin">1 Cor. 4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Iudge nothing before the time, vntill the Lord come, who will lighten thinges that are hid in darkneſſe, and make the counſels of the heart manifeſt, and then ſhall euery man haue praiſe of God.</hi> The ſecrets of God belong vnto him, wee are not to ſearch into them, but to adore them.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">[<hi>Knowing that thou wilt doe euen more then I ſay.</hi>]</q> This is a confirmation of the former concluſion, drawne from a compariſon of the greater to the leſſe, in this manner: <hi>I doubt not but thou wilt receiue him, becauſe thou art ready to perfourme more then I require at thy handes,</hi> which is amplified and enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by an humane teſtimony, <hi>I know it well enough.</hi> Heere then wee may ſee, the good opinion that <hi>Paule</hi> had conceiued of <hi>Philemon,</hi> that he was willing not onely to graunt whatſoeuer he craued of him, but to yeeld more then he required. <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Doctrine</hi> 5.

The people of God haue from time to time ſhewed themſelues ready, not onely to do what they haue beene commanded, but to practiſe more then hath beene charged vpon them.</p>
               <p>This we ſee in the Children of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> when they were required to bring their Offerings <note n="y" place="margin">Exod. 35, 5, &amp; 36, 5, 6.</note> to the Lord with a willing heart, they brought too much &amp; more then enough, for the vſe of the worke and the building of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. They were not ſlacke and backward in furthering the ſeruice of the Sanctuary, but zealous and forward in promoting the glory of God and the place of his worſhip, ſo that they prepared and preſented more then was looked for at their handes. When <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaw that the plague was ſtayed, and the hand of God remooued from him and his people, he was willed to go vp and reare an Altar vnto the Lord in the threſhing floore of <hi>Araunah</hi> the <hi>Iebuſite</hi> (where the Angell ſtood being commanded to ſtay his hand) which he deſired to buy with his money: but <hi>Araunah</hi> ſaid vnto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>True it is, <hi>Dauid</hi> would not accept of this kindneſſe, nor offer a burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering vnto the Lord his God, <hi>of that which coſt him nothing,</hi> ſo that he boght the threſhing floore &amp; the Oxen of him at a price; notwithſtanding, it ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the readineſſe, willingneſſe, and forwardneſſe of this good man to doo more then was required at his hands. And as we ſaw the free-heartedneſſe of the people at the building of the Tabernacle: ſo we may ſee the ſame in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for the building of the Temple, for when <hi>Dauid</hi> prouoked the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by word and example to offer freely, and ſaid <note n="a" place="margin">1 Chro. 29, 20, 21.</note>

The Princes of the families, and the Princes of the Tribes of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell, and the Captaines of thouſands, and of hundreths, with the Rulers of the Kings worke, offered willingly, and they gaue for the ſeruice of the houſe of God, fiue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Talents of Gold, &amp;c. and they with whom precious ſtones were found, gaue them to the Treaſure of the houſe of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> So that among them they

                  <hi>brought more to the helping forward of the building of the Temple, then Dauid looked for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like we ſee in the practiſe of the Churches of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for the Saints of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> not onely as they were able, but beyonde that which they were able: for though themſelues were brought to great miſery, and extreame pouerty, yet they fainted not, but became ſo forward, that he ſaith of them, <note n="b" place="margin">2 Cor. 8, 3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>I beare them record, that to their power; yea, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their power, they were willing, and they prayed vs with great inſtance, that we would receiue the grace and fellowſpip of the Miniſtring which is towardes the Saints.</hi> The Apoſtle craueth of them a little, and they performe much: hee beſeecheth them to do according to their power, and they bring vnto him beyond their power. By all theſe examples, as by a Iury of many witneſſes, it appeareth, that the faithfull will not hang backe, but be ready to performe and practiſe more then is required of them; they will not do leſſe, but more then is looked for at their hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 1.</note> Though this truth be plaine in it ſelfe, yet it will bee made much plainer by reaſons. Firſt of all, the obedience of the faithfull, will ſuper-abound, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſet before them the example of God, and delight to come neere vnto him. They haue experience of his bountifull dealing toward them, he is ready to graunt not onely what they aske, but more then they aske.

We cannot yeeld more then is looked for at our hands, vnleſſe we be earneſt and feruent in the ſpirit, as men that are led by the ſpirite. True it is, there is no warrant to walke without our warrant, or to runne too faſt without any guide. Hence it is, that <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7, 18, 19. <hi>Be not thou iust ouer-much, neither make thy ſelfe ouer wiſe, wherefore ſhouldſt thou be deſolate? Be not thou wicked ouer much, neither be thou fooliſh; wherefore ſhouldeſt thou periſh, not in thy time?</hi> Meaning thereby, that as we ſhould not ſuffer ſinne to raigne in our mortall bodies (though we cannot wholly driue it away) ſo we ſhould not ſeeke a righteouſneſſe beyond the Law. This ouer-much righteouſnes was in him, who being commanded in the name of God <note n="i" place="margin">1 Kin. 20, 35.</note> to ſmite the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, &amp; in ſmiting to wound him, refuſed to obey, becauſe it ſeemed ſtrange vnto him to wound a man that was godly, and not guilty of any crime. The like is that which <hi>Saul</hi> did, <note n="k" place="margin">1 Sa. 15, 21.</note> who being expreſly charged and forbidden to ſaue aliue any perſons or Cattle that belonged to the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> preſerued the chiefeſt of the things, and the choiſeſt of the Oxen and Sheep to offer vp in ſacrifice vnto the Lord. But the one of them was ſlaine of a Lyon; the other loſt his kingdome; to teach vs, that to obey is better then ſacrifice; &amp; to hearken, is better then the fat of Rams. So then, we muſt vnderſtand, that albeit we are to be ready to yeeld more then well can be required of vs, yet we muſt not thinke to do more then God requireth of vs. If we ſpeak of the duties that God commandeth, we come far ſhort when we haue done what we can, &amp; we muſt confeſſe we are vnprofitable ſeruants; but when we ſpeak of good and Chriſtian duties which our Miniſters or brethren craue of vs; &amp; deſire vs to practiſe, we ſhould willingly perfourme more then they aske at our hands. Let vs therefore bee feruent and zealous in al lawful and honeſt thinges. It is good alwayes to be earneſt in a good thing. The Lord ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth and deteſteth the Luke-warme <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> that are neither hot nor cold, but wil ſpew them out of his mouth. If any ſhould deale in our cauſe for vs, we would not haue him deale negligently and careleſly: ſhal we then be remiſſe and careleſſe, when we deale in matters that belong to God, and our owne ſaluation? Shal we deale as men benummed with cold, that ſeeme to haue no life in them, but are frozen-hearted, and haue no motion of the ſpirit of God in vs? Let vs not ſtand at a ſtay, but alwaies proceed forward, as Trauellers that haſten to the end of their iourney: or as Sea-faring men, that thinke it long vntil they lye at rode in the Hauen, as in a ſafe harbour from winde and weather. This ſerueth to reprooue al thoſe, that accuſe and reproach others, for being too forward and zealous. If wee bee not zealous in Religion, we are of no religion, whatſoeuer we account of our ſelues.</p>

<pb n="434" facs="tcp:7222:231"/> are forward and chearefull beyond expectation in good things. A notable example of both, is offered to our conſideration, in the prouiſion that was made, and the furniture that was prouided for the building of the Temple, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 9. Where we ſee, that when <hi>Dauid</hi> himſelfe hauing a great zeal and delight in the houſe of his God, gaue of his owne Gold and Siluer, and the people and Princes following his example, ſpared no coſt and expenſes, it is ſaid, <hi>The people reioyced when they offered willingly, for they offered willingly to the Lord, with a perfect hart: and Dauid the King alſo reioyced with great ioy.</hi> Againe, there is great occaſion offred vnto vs to glorifie God, &amp; to praiſe his name, whenſoeuer he worketh this willingneſſe in the hearts of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dsen, and when we ſee their zeale to abound, and their readineſſe to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any requeſt that we can make vnto them. It is a property of the good and diligent ſeruant, who being bidden to go, will run about his buſineſſe; or being required to do little, will gird vp his loynes and doe more: as, on the other ſide, the Wiſeman teacheth, <hi>Prou.</hi> 10, 26. that <hi>as Vineger is to the Teeth, and ſmoake to the eyes, ſo is the ſlouthfull to them that ſend him.</hi> When we behold ſuch an encreaſe in godlineſſe, and a running in the race of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian duties, let vs be mindfull to giue God the glory and the praiſe, who hath touched their hearts to bring forth ſo great fruits. Contrarywiſe, it is the cauſe of much griefe and ſorrow, when men deceiue the hope and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation that is conceiued of them in the beſt thinges, when we looke for a plentifull Harueſt, and finde onely a few blaſted eares; when wee expect an encreaſe, and ſee nothing but a fearefull fainting and languiſhing in honeſt and holy duties. This is it which the Author of the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes reproueth in them, <note n="p" place="margin">Heb. 5, 21.</note> 
                  <hi>When, as concerning the time, ye ought to bee Teachers, yet haue ye need againe that we teach you, what are the firſt principles of the worde of GOD: and are become ſuch as haue neede of Milke, and not of strong Meate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like reproofe is caſt vpon the Galathians, Chap. 3, 1. <hi>O fooliſh Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, who hath bewitched you, that ye ſhould not obey the trueth to whom Ieſus Christ was before deſcribed in your ſight, and among you crucified?</hi> Oh! ſee, ſee, the miſery of our dayes, all come ſhort of the duties that are required of them, be they neuer ſo iuſt, honeſt, neceſſarie, ſo greatly to Gods glorie, and the aduancement of true Religion. If men would come thus farre, to yeeld halfe ſo much as is requeſted of them; or as farre as they ſhould, wee ſhould iudge it much, and it would appeare greater then it is. Beholde, the barrenneſſe and backwardneſſe of our daies, that yeeld no better fruit. If a man would take a Light, and ſearch vppe and downe from houſe to houſe, where ſhall he finde a true-hearted <hi>Philemon,</hi> of whom we may boldly ſay, as <hi>Paule</hi> doth in this place; <hi>I know that thou wilt do euen more then I ſay?</hi> I would we were come thus farre, to ſay of our profeſſors, <hi>I know thou wilt do as much as I ſay.</hi> We haue not learned to performe ſo much; we have ſtarted backe from our former zeale; we are fallen from much, to little; and from little, to nothing at all; and from nothing, to leſſe then nothing; that is, from no good, to much euill. For, how many might a man ſingle out by name, and point out with the finger, who nothwithſtanding their happy beginnings, &amp; rayſing a woonderfull expectation of a glorious end, are now become dry and withered; of whom we may ſay, I knowe thou wilt doe nothing, I know there is nothing in them, I know they haue embraced this preſent World. Theſe are <note n="q" place="margin">Iob 6, 15, 16, &amp;c.</note> like thoſe Streames or Channelles, which immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after a ſhowre of Raine runne ſwiftly, and promiſe to the poore Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueller, that wandereth in the VVilderneſſe, a moſt comfortable refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but in time of neede deceiue him: So is it with ſuch as haue embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Faith, and ſeeme to haue receyued into their drie heartes the ſweet <note n="r" place="margin">Deut. 32, 2.</note> Dewes, and pleaſant ſhowers of the Word, who appeare zealous for

               <p>The Doctrine, that hath dropped vpon them as the raine vpon the hearbes, and the great raine vpon the graſſe, is quite dried vp, and no remnants ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are to be diſcerned; according to the ſaying of Chriſt, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Math. 25, 29.</note> 
                  <hi>Vnto euery man that hath, it ſhall be giuen, and he ſhall haue abundance: but from him that hath not, euen that he hath ſhalbe taken away.</hi> This is notably expreſſed in the parable of the Man that going into a ſtrange Country, called his ſeruants, deliuered and deuided to them his goods, and when one of them went his way and hidde his Talent in the earth, it was taken from him that had beene ſlouthfull, and giuen to him that had gained fiue Talents. Againe, if the time would ſerue, it were eaſie to ſhew, how ſumptuous, coſtly, and full of expenſes men are, to maintaine their vanities, pleaſures, and delights, aboue that we can deſire or imagine: but in other thinges moſt nigh and niggard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and hand-faſted. We ſee how waſting and prodigall they are in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of their carnall luſtes, they thinke no coſt to be too much, no charges too great.</p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 3.</note> Laſtly, it is the duty of euery man to labour to be anſwearable at the leaſt to the expectation that the Church hath had of him, and to endeuour to be as good as he hath made ſhew off, perfourming therein the practiſe of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, not deceiuing any of the Seruants of God therein. This requireth of vs a carefull obſeruation and marking of the manners of men, both of their beginnings, and proceedings, and not to ſtand (as idle behoulders) gazing in the aire; that we may vnderſtand the time, the meanes, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe, the knowledge, the ſhew that hath beene in many; all which haue promiſed much, and cauſed vs to expect good thinges at their handes, and yet oftentimes in vaine. This appeareth in the ſong of the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> Chap. 5. Wherein he ſetteth before the peoples eyes their great vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, <note n="t" place="margin">Eſay, 5, 4.</note> that albeit the Lord had done for his Vineyard what he could, yet it brought forth wilde Grapes in ſtead of good Fruit: and therfore he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that the Thornes ſhall ouergrow it, the Beaſtes ſhould ſpoile it, the Raine ſhall not nouriſh it. Thus alſo the Apoſtle ſpeaketh to the Hebrewes, who as hee exhorteth them, that leauing the Doctrine of the beginning of Chriſt they ſhould be led forward vnto perfection, ſo he threatneth ſuch as turne backward with an horrible iudgement that ſhall come vpon them, a fearefull curſe that ſhall ouertake them, <note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 6, 7, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>For the earth (ſaith he) that drinketh in the raine that commeth oft vpon it, and bringeth forth Hearbes meet for them by whom it is dreſſed, receiueth bleſſing of God: but that which beareth Thornes and Briars, is reproued, and is neere vnto curſing, whoſe end is to be burned.</hi> Whereby we ſee that an heauy curſe belongeth vnto all ſuch as anſweare not the hope that is conceiued of them: they deceiue men much, they deceiue as farre (as lieth in them) God himſelfe, but eſpecially they deceiue their owne ſoules. We pitty thoſe greatly, whom we haue ſeene freſh and luſty, ſtrong and ſturdy of body, when they grow weake, faint, ſickly, and decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in age and ſtrength: but much more ought we to lament to ſee thoſe that haue beene forward and gone before many others, to haue need to be taught againe the firſt principles of Religion, and to feed on Milke as they that are inexpert in the word of Righteouſneſſe. It is a ſigne of health, when men grow in ſtrength and ſtature: and it is a token of the true Childe of God, when men grow in grace. This is it which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh to the Corrinthians, <note n="x" place="margin">2 Cor. 8, 7.</note>

                  <hi>Shew toward them and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Churches, the proofe of your loue, and of the reioycing that we haue of you.</hi> Likewiſe, <hi>Timothy</hi> had great praiſe in the Church, who, according to the
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:7222:232"/> propheſies that went before of him, did anſwer the expectation of the faithful, approuing himſelfe in the ſight of God and men. Heerevnto commeth the counſell and commaundement of the Apoſtle; <note n="z" place="margin">1 Tim. 4, 15</note> 
                  <hi>Theſe thinges exerciſe, and giue thy ſeife vnto them, that it may be ſeene how thou profitest in all thinges.</hi> It is a great comfort and encouragement to the people of God, to ſee any the members of Chriſt to proſper and profit in good thinges: On the otherſide, it miniſtreth occaſion of much griefe and heauineſſe of heart, to behold the zeale of the Spirit quenched, and the light of the Goſpell that hath ſhined in their minds, eclipſed. If a man ſhould looke vpon the members of his own body, and ſee any one of them ſhriueled and withered; as Arme, or hand, or Leg, not proſpering, not growing, not mouing, not receiuing life from the head: it would worke ſorrow in vs, and we would pitty others, in whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we ſhould ſee ſuch infirmities. In like manner, we muſt be well aſſured, it cannot but greatly greeue the Church of God, to behold the parts thereof to begin to faint and waxe feeble, to grow groueling downeward, when they ſhould caſt vp their eyes to Heauen, and liue as Cittizens of that Kingdome.</p>

For we haue already ſhewed, that the principall ſcope of this Epiſtle is double: one touching <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> which hath thus far beene expounded; the other, touching <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, which now commeth to be conſidered. This point is knit vnto the former, and hath an euident dependance vpon it, and is amplified by a tranſition in the firſt words [<hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer alſo.</hi>] Heereby he doth effectually mooue <hi>Philemon,</hi> and ſeeketh to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his former purpoſe. For when he heareth that he ſhall ſhortly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Apoſtle himſelfe in his houſe, it muſt needes kindle a greater for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe and willingneſſe in him to graunt his requeſt, leaſt hee make him heauy, and deceiue his expectation. Whereas therefore, <hi>Philemon</hi> might haue thought with himſelfe, and thus reaſoned touching <hi>Paules</hi> ſuit; It skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not whether I graunt it or not, he hath beene a moſt lewd Seruant vnto me, and <hi>Paule</hi> liueth farre off from me, he is held in Priſon at <hi>Rome:</hi> eyther he will not heare what becommeth of <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> or if he doe heare, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture he ſhall neuer be deliuered out of priſon, but remaine a Priſoner all the daies of his life; and therefore I will deal with <hi>Oneſimus</hi> as ſeemeth good to my ſelfe. Theſe and ſuch like imaginations, the Apoſtle putteth out of his head, and telleth him he ſhould ſhortly looke for his comming vnto him, whereby he ſhould know what account he made of his wordes, and what obedience he would yeeld to his requeſt.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that for this cauſe <hi>Paule</hi> craueth to haue lodging prepared for him, rather by <hi>Philemon,</hi> then any other Citizen at <hi>Coloſſe:</hi> not that he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red much prouiſion and preparation to bee made for his entertainement, <note n="a" place="margin">Phil. 4, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Who had taught others, and learned himſelfe to be content with a little,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by this commaundement, as by a ſharpe Sword, he would pierce the Bowels of <hi>Philemon,</hi> and as by a ſtrong Engine, batter the Fort and Bulwark of his heart, and throughly perſwade him, and preuaile with him, to receiue <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> both into his houſe, and into his fauour. In this verſe, we haue to conſider two pointes: firſt, a Commaundment; ſecondly, a reaſon whereby the commaundement is ſtrengthened. The commaundement is, to prepare
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:7222:232"/> him hoſtage and lodging: wherein he anſwereth a double doubt and queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that might ariſe in him, and trouble the motion and matter that <hi>Paule</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. For firſt he might haue ſaide; I may vſe <hi>Oneſimus</hi> as I liſt, <hi>Paule</hi> is farre enough from hearing of it. Againe, he might haue thought, <note n="b" place="margin">

                  </note> It is well he had ſuch a cauſe to plead, and ſuch a requeſt to make, otherwiſe I ſhould neuer haue heard from him. Theſe ſuſpitions the Apoſtle remooueth, when he ſaith in this place; I haue not written for his cauſe alone, but for my ſelfe, that thou make account to be mine Hoſt, and to receiue mee into thine Houſe. The reaſon is drawne from the working cauſe, I hope to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto you through your Prayers, and may be thus frame;
<list type="syllogism">
                     <item>

               </p>
               <p>Or rather, the latter part of this Verſe is the the taking away of an Obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which <hi>Philemon</hi> might haue made, vpon the hearing of the charge gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto him of preparing him lodging, which may be thus ſupplyed. Shall wee looke for thy comming? Why, Thou art a Priſoner?

To this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle aunſwereth; <hi>I hope in ſhort time to be deliuered:</hi> whereunto he annexeth two cauſes of his hope, that he might know it was, not builded in the Ayre without foundation, but grounded and eſtabliſhed ſufficiently, relying vpon the prayers of the faithfull, and vpon the grace and mercy of God.</p>

When he ſaith [<hi>Prepare me lodging</hi>] he meaneth the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement of Hoſpitality, whereof lodging is but a part. The word ſignifieth al things requiſite for the well vſing of a Stranger; as receiuing to Houſe, food, lodging, and all other neceſſaries belonging thereunto, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many parts are expreſſed <note n="c" place="margin">1 Tim. 5, 10</note> by the Apoſtle, in the deſcription of the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes that were to be taken to ſerue the Church, in attending vnto the ſicke. In the next place when he ſaith, [<hi>I hope through your Prayers, &amp;c.</hi>] it argueth, that the Churches of the Gentiles did pray vnceſſantly vnto God, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance of <hi>Paul</hi> out of Priſon; as we ſee in the Actes of the Apoſtles, when <hi>Herod</hi> had killed <hi>Iames,</hi> and put <hi>Peter</hi> in Priſon, <note n="d" place="margin">Actes 12, 5.</note> earneſt Prayer was made of the Church to God for him. So that we ſee he had the Prayers of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and that he did acknowledge the benefit &amp; neceſſity of them, that they ſhould preuaile with God.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, when he addeth [<hi>I ſhall be giuen vnto you.</hi>] We muſt vnderſtand, that the word which the Holie Ghoſt vſeth in this place, ſignifieth to bee freely and frankly giuen: noting thereby, that when he ſhould be deliuered, and finde the effect of their Prayers, it ſhould be through the free grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, and not merited by the Saints. So then, according to this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the words, and interpretation of the Text, the reading of this Verſe is to this effect. Hauing now ended my ſuit mooued vnto thee touching <hi>Oneſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> I am in the next place to ſollicite thee for my ſelfe; namely, that as thou art inclined in loue to all the Saints of God, ſo that thou prepare thy ſelfe to entertaine me at thy houſe, with all the fruits of hoſpitality. For although I be in bonds, and kept faſt in hold, yet my hope is; that by reaſon of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall and effectuall Prayers of the Saints, I ſhall ere long, through the free
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:7222:233"/> mercies of God be giuen vnto you, and to the other Churches, for their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther edification in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">General obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out in this verſe.</note> Thus much touching the meaning. Now follow certaine generall obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations, which I will onely point out, and not ſtand vpon at large. Firſt of all, obſerue the different manner of the Apoſtles dealing heere, and in the former words. When he entreateth for another, he is large and earneſt, but when he commendeth to him his owne cauſe and priuate buſineſſe, he dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in a word; he diſpatcheth it breefely; he toucheth it by the way; as if it were a thing impertinent, or from the matter. This ſheweth, that he had more reſpect, and a greater regard to obtaine his ſuit for <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> and to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his ſaluation, then to ſpeed in his owne ſuit, which pertained to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting and ſupplying the neceſſities of this preſent life. This teacheth vs to be more earneſt in another mans cauſe then in our owne, but eſpeciallie all Paſtours, that haue the charge of Soules committed vnto them, to bee more earneſt for the ſauing of Soules, then to procure their owne eaſe; and that they ſeeke the benefit of others, rather then the profit of themſelues; according to the rule of the Apoſtle. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <note n="e" place="margin">1 Pet. 5, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Feede the Flocke of God that dependeth vpon you, caring for it; not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre, but of a ready mind.</hi> This affection if it be found in vs, ſhall miniſter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding comfort to our hearts, when we remember that we haue imployed our guifts and labours to gaine a people to God, and haue not ſought theirs, but them. On the other ſide, woe vnto idle Shepheards, that feede not the Flocke, but feede themſelues. Such as are to worke in the Lords Vineyard muſt be Labourers, not Loyterers; they muſt be able to feed, not to fleeſe; they muſt blow the Trumpet, and not hold their peace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Apoſtle doth not aſſure himſelfe or the Churches of God that he ſhall be deliuered, but [<hi>he hopeth</hi>] to be ſet free, as if he ſhould ſay; I haue conceiued an hope not vaine and fooliſh, without ground of reaſon, but I truſt in Gods mercy to be ſet in ſafety, that I may ſerue the Church, and profit you in the Goſpell a long time. Now, whether the Apoſtle being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered out of Priſon, euer came among the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and tooke vp his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in the Houſe of <hi>Philemon,</hi> it is vncertaine, and not to be found in the holy Scriptures. The like hope he conceiueth in other places of his Epiſtles, as when he writeth to the <hi>Phillippians,</hi> Chapt. 1. <note n="f" place="margin">Phil. 1, 24, 25</note> 
                  <hi>To abide in the fleſh is more needefull for you, and this am I ſure off, that I ſhall abide, and with you all conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, for your furtherance and ioy of your Faith.</hi> And in the Chapter following, <note n="g" place="margin">Phil. 2, 23, 24</note> 
                  <hi>I hope to ſend Timothy as ſoone as I know how it will goe with me: and I trust in the Lord, that I alſo my ſelfe ſhall come ſhortly.</hi> The like wee ſee in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> (if that were <hi>Paules</hi>) Chapt. 13. <note n="h" place="margin">Hebr. 13, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Know that our Brother Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motheus is deliuered, with whom (if he come ſhortly) I will ſee you.</hi> Obſerue in this place, that his hope is not abſolute, but condicionall; not ſimply purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but limited; <hi>I hope in the Lorde.</hi> This is expreſſed by him in the firſt Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romaines,</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 1, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>I make mention of you alwaies in my Prayers, beſeeching that by ſome meanes, one time or other, I might haue a prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous iourney by the will of God, to come vnto you.</hi> Wee muſt therefore know, that all our ſteppes are directed of God, they are not in our owne power to be ordered at our owne pleaſure. We muſt alſo beware of all vaine confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and preſumption in our ſelues, and in vnder-taking our buſineſſe and affaires of this life, ſeeing the ſucceſſe is vnknowne, and our life is vncertain. Whatſoeuer we take in hand, we muſt depend vpon the prouidence of God, and rely vpon his will.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> reprooueth them that ſay, <note n="k" place="margin">Iames. 4, 13, 14, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Goe to now ye that ſay, to day or to morrow we will goe into ſuch a Cittie, and continue there a yeare, and buy and ſell, and get gaine: (and yet ye cannot tell what ſhall be to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.) For what is your life? It is euen a vapour that appeareth but a little time,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:7222:233"/> and afterward vaniſheth away: For that ye ought to ſay, If the Lord will, both we ſhall liue, and we ſhall doe this and that.</hi> God is the cheefe Ruler and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of all perſons and actions, nothing is guided and gouerned by Fortune, nor falleth out by Chance: he ſitteth as it were at the Sterne, and ordereth al things to his owne glory, and the good of his Church.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he putteth them in hope and comfort, that he ſhould be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and come vnto them, as a matter that would be welcome and profitable vnto them. Which teacheth, that the company, fellowſhip, and preſence of the faithfull Seruants of God, is much to bee deſired and looked after, and much to be reioyced in. Thereby they receiue mutuall comfort one in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and beſtow mutuall graces one vpon another, and likewiſe by hauing the fellowſhip one of another, they whet and ſharpen one another. We are ready to grow dull, as an edge-toole that is quickly blunted and turned. Now the communion and communication which we haue together among our ſelues, will quicken our Faith, and kindle our zeale, that it will breake out into a great flame. Hence it followeth, that they are happy that delight to frequent the company of the godly, and of ſuch as may profit vs in the beſt things. He that walketh with the wiſe, ſhall be the wiſer; but he that is a companion of Fooles, ſhall learne fooliſhneſſe. Wherefore, they are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by reprooued, that neuer thinke themſelues better at eaſe, then when they are fartheſt from them that delight in the Lorde, and take pleaſure in lewd and ryotous company, by whom they are miſled and carryed out of the right way.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, wee ſee that the Apoſtle alwaies aſcribeth much to to the Prayers of the Saints. We know, that <hi>Paule</hi> was one of the cheefe of the Apoſtles, whoſe guifts were great; whoſe labours were painefull; whoſe viſions and reuelations were wonderfull; yet he reiecteth not the praiers of the Church; as appeareth in this place, and <note n="l" place="margin">Phil. 1, 19.</note> Phil. 1, 19. <hi>I know that this ſhall turne to my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation through your prayer, and by the helpe of the ſpirit of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> So then, the excellency of any member and worthineſſe of the cheefeſt in the Church, doth not exempt him from ſtanding in neede of the Prayers of the pooreſt Chriſtian and loweſt part of the Church. Nay, the greater and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and more eminent any man is, the more he hath need to be praied for, and commended to the grace of God; inaſmuch as he is ſet in a more ſlipperie place, he lyeth open to greater daunger, and is expoſed to ſtronger tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and aſſaults of Sathan, then thoſe that are in a lower place, and a meaner condition. Such then as excell others in guifts or calling, ought to deſire the prayers of the faithfull (which auaile much if they be feruent) no leſſe, if not more then others. Note alſo the great neceſſity and force of prayer, that all perſons, as well high as low, ſtand in neede of it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, let euery one labour to haue a feeling of his owne want of the ſupplication of others; yea, the higher we are ſet, the greater will be our fal, if we be not ſtrongly aſſiſted by all ſuch meanes as God hath left, to further our ſaluation and deliuerance out of troubles that hemme vs in on euery ſide. Hitherto of the obſeruations: Now let vs come to particular doctrines.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">[<hi>Moreouer alſo, prepare me lodging.</hi>]</q> He requireth in theſe words, of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon,</hi> an entertaining of ſuch as are deſtitute, and driuen out of houſe and home for the Goſpels ſake; as if he ſhould ſay, when any of the poore Saints are baniſhed, perſecuted, and put to great extreamities, as the World doth alwaies carry an hard and vnmercifull hand toward them, be carefull to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them cheerefully, and to miniſter al comfort ye can vnto them willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. The word therefore vſed in this place, hath a generall ſignification, and containeth all duties belonging to the entertainement of Strangers. And by Strangers we meane, not ſuch as ordinarily come to viſite vs, nor ſuch as
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:7222:234"/> trauaile about the buſineſſe of this life, and take vp their lodgings in Innes or Tauernes: but ſuch as fly from place to place, and are compelled againſt their wils, to leaue Countrey, or Kindred, or Houſe, for the Goſpels ſake. The word vſed in this place, is not to be reſtrained to giuing of them lodging, as if they had diſcharged ſo much as could be required of them, but vnder that, all duties of the ſame kind and nature are comprehended; as Meate, Drink, Apparrell, and all other thinges neceſſary for them. Theſe the Apoſtle knew would be ioyfully yeelded by <hi>Philemon</hi> to him, and all other the faithfull, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſuch as labour in the word and Doctrine. <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. Hoſpitality is diligently to be vſed &amp; pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed of all the Children of God.</note> Hereby we learne for our inſtruction, that Hoſpitality; that is, the curteous and ioyfull entertainment of diſtreſſed Strangers, is to be vſed and practiſed diligently by all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. The ſuccouring of Straungers that are deſtitute, eſpeciallie the poore Miniſters that are imployed, or would be imployed in the affaires of the Church, is required of vs.</p>
               <p>This we ſee in the examples of ſundry of the faithfull, one very famous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, is the <hi>Shunamites</hi> Wife, <note n="m" place="margin">2 Kin. 4, 8, 9</note> 
                  <hi>Who called the Prophet of God to her houſe to eate Bread;</hi> and ſhe ſaid to her Husband; <hi>Behold, I know now, that this is an holie Man of God that paſſeth by vs continually, let vs make him a little Chamber with Walles, and let vs ſet him there a Bed, and a Table, and a Stoole, and a Candlesticke, that he may turne in thither when he commeth to vs.</hi> This is it which the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> commendeth, Chapt. 58. 7. <hi>Is not this the faſting that I haue choſen,</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Eſay 58, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>to deale thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that wander vnto thine houſe? When thou ſeeſt the naked, that thou couer him, &amp; hide not thy ſelfe from thine owne Fleſh?</hi> This is noted as a part of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and integrity of <hi>Iob,</hi> Chapt. 31. <note n="o" place="margin">Iob 31, 32.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſtranger did not lodge in the ſtreet, but I opened my doores vnto him that went by the way.</hi> The like wee might ſay of of the Woman of <note n="p" place="margin">1 King. 17. Luke 10. Iohn 11. Luke 19. Actes 16. 2 Tim. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Sarepta,</hi> that entertained <hi>Eliah</hi> in the time of famine: of <hi>Lazarus</hi> and his Siſters, that receiued Chriſt into their houſe: of <hi>Zache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> who lodged him ioyfully: of <hi>Lydia,</hi> who intreated <hi>Paul</hi> and his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to come into her houſe, and to abide with her: of <hi>Oneſiphorus,</hi> who ſought out the Apoſtle diligently, refreſhed him oftentimes, and was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of his Chaines. All theſe examples, Regiſtred and recorded in the Olde and New Teſtament, teach vs, that God requireth it as a ſpeciall dutie at our handes; to entertaine, lodge, and refreſh ſuch poore Straungers as are conſtrained to wander vp and downe, either for preaching or profeſſing of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 1.</note> This dutie is vrged vpon vs by diuers reaſons in the holy Scriptures. Firſt, it is to be practiſed of vs, becauſe it is the commandement of God, that wee ſhould loue and lodge ſtrangers, and ſhew all pitty and compaſſion toward them, to ſuccour them in their neceſſity. This is it which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, Deut. 10. <note n="q" place="margin">Deut. 10, 19</note> 
                  <hi>Loue ye the Stranger, for ye were Strangers in the Land of Aegipt.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto commeth the rule of the Apoſtle, Rom. 12. <note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 12, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Diſtribute to the neceſſities of the Saintes, giue your ſelues to Hospitality.</hi> This is the precept of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> Chapt. 4. <note n="ſ" place="margin">1 Pet. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Be ye harborous one to another, without gruding.</hi> Seeing therefore God commaundeth, it is our part to obey, and ſubmit our ſelues to his will and pleaſure.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 2</note> Secondly, as God requireth this duty of vs, ſo wee haue his owne exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to teach it vnto vs. It is a propertie of God to loue Strangers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be imitated and followed of all that belong vnto him. This reaſon is expreſſed in the Booke of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> Chapt, 10, 18. <hi>The Lord our God, is God of Gods, and Lord of Lords, a great God, mighty and terrible, who doth</hi>

                  <hi>right vnto the Fatherleſſe and Widdow, and loueth the Stranger, giuing him foode and rayment, loue ye therefore the Stranger.</hi> Where we ſee, he vrgeth this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to loue the ſtranger, mooued by the example of God himſelfe, who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ready to helpe him, and to defend him: ſo that it ought to bee our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:7222:234"/> and delight to ſtudy to be like vnto our heauenly Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 3.</note> Thirdly, God doth greatly honour ſuch as honour Strangers: they haue beene ſo farre honored by God, as that Angels haue entred into their houſes, been entertained by them, and haue bleſſed them. This the Apoſtle teacheth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. <note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 13, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Be not forgetfull to entertaine Strangers: for thereby ſome haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Angels into their Houſes vnawares:</hi> Declaring heereby, that they which in the ſimplicitie of their hearts ſerue God, and comfort his Saintes in the duties of Hoſpitalitie, and other fruites of loue, ſhall obtaine great honour, and many bleſſings from GOD, euen more then euer they thought of, or could expect at his handes; as we ſee in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> who became the Hoaſts of his ſpeciall Seruants, moſt deare vnto him, euen the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Angels, nay of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who was among them. Thus doth the Lord honour them that honour him. Seeing therefore God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth this duty in his word, approueth of it by his example, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the performance of it in his Seruants, it teacheth, that the kinde enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement of ſuch as are deſolate and deſtitute Strangers, poore Widdows, or fatherleſſe, friendleſſe, and comfortleſſe Orphans, is an acceptable ſeruice approued in the eies of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1</note> The doctrine being thus cleered, the Vſes remaine to bee ſhewed. Firſt, this declareth, that Hoſpitality is a commendable vertue, and a worthy fruit of loue; yea, an excellent ornament in the Children of God, whereby they receiue good report of the Church. We ſee this in <hi>Rahab,</hi> 
                  <note n="x" place="margin">Heb. 11, 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Who by Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the Spies peaceably, and ſent them out another way.</hi> We ſee this in the old Man of Mount <hi>Ephraim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that dwelt in <hi>Gibeah,</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Iudg. 19, 20.</note> who wiſhed peace vnto the Leuite and his wife, and brought him into his houſe, and gaue Fodder vnto the Aſſes; there they waſhed their feete; there they did eate and drinke; and there their harts were merry. So the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. commendeth <hi>Phebe,</hi> a deare Siſter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> 
                  <note n="z" place="margin">Rom. 16, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>That they receiue her in the Lord as it becommeth Saints, and that they aſſist her in whatſoeuer buſineſſe ſhe needeth of their ayd: for ſhe hath giuen Hospitalitie vnto many, and vnto himſelfe alſo.</hi> Likewiſe <hi>Gaius</hi> is commended <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 16, 23 3 Iohn 5.</note> to the Hoſt of <hi>Paule,</hi> and of the whole Church: yea, to bee faithfull to all the Brethren, and to Straungers, which did beare witneſſe of his loue. The Church was then in perſecution; the people of God were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten driuen into baniſhment. There were in thoſe daies no Innes to receiue Straungers, and to entertaine Trauailers, as there were afterward, and now are in all places. Euery godlie mans houſe ought to be their Inne to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them. We loue the truth, as we loue the entertainement of thoſe that profeſſe it, and ſuffer for it. Eſpecially it is required of vs, to make much of the true Miniſters of Chriſt Ieſus, when we ſee them made as Straungers, to want houſe, liuing, maintenance. Seeing therefore many troubles were raiſed through the tyranny of the Enemies againſt the Saintes; ſo that they were conſtrained to forſake their Country and Kindred, to enioy the profeſſion of the Faith, and the peace of a good conſcience: the Apoſtles of Chriſt do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes beat vppon this point, and require this duty, to receiue ſuch to our houſes as the World reiected, and accounted vnworthy of the company of men. If we do good to theſe poore members of Chriſt, that <note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 11, 37, 38.</note> 
                  <hi>are glad to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vp and downe in ſheeps skins, and in Goats skins, being deſtitute, afflicted, and tormented;</hi> who, to ſaue their liues from the rage of the oppreſſour, and the ſword of the perſecuter, were driuen to hide their heads in Wilderneſſes, and Mountaines, and Dennes, and Caues of the Earth; we teſtifie our vnfained loue to the truth, and to the Bretheren; nay, to Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe, as we ſhall ſee and ſhew afterward. But if we do good to ſuch as are able to requite it, and to ſuch as are linked vnto vs by Kindred, or any other band, it is no true triall, no due proofe, no perfect teſtimony of our charity.</p>
               <p>True it is, kindneſſe and humanity are good, if they be ordered aright,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:7222:235"/> and ruled according to pietie and godlineſſe: but when they extend farther, euen to ſuch as are not able to recompence it, and to ſuch as are vnknowne vnto vs, therein wee make demonſtration, that we ſerue God in ſinceritie, and hold faſt the right rule of Charity. Such as are at home in their owne Countrey, ſhall finde releefe enough, they ſhall haue Kinsfolke to miniſter help and ſuccor vnto them, according to the ſaying of the <hi>Shunamite,</hi> when the Prophet ſaid vnto her; <note n="c" place="margin">2 Kin. 4, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold thou haſt had all this great care for vs, what ſhall we do for thee? Is there any thing to be ſpoken for thee to the King, or to the Captaine of the Hoſt:</hi> ſhe anſwered; <hi>I dwell among mine owne people.</hi> But ſuch as are poore godly ſtrangers are deſtitute of help; they haue neither Friends nor Kinsfolkes; they haue neither aide nor fauour ſhewed vnto them; they lie open to all iniuries and indignities. The poore Children of God are often exiled and baniſhed from their houſes, and are as ſillie Birds whoſe neſts are taken, ſo that they know not whether to go, or what to doe, or whom to flie vnto, or vnder whoſe roofe to ſhroude themſelues, from the ſtorme and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt that hath ouertaken them. Now the greater their miſerie is the more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted is our charity: and the more heauy their perſecution is, the better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted is our compaſsion, which ſhall neuer be forgotten, but receiue a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. This is that promiſe which Chriſt our Sauiour maketh; <note n="d" place="margin">Math. 10, 42.</note> 
                  <hi>Whoſoeuer ſhall giue vnto one of theſe little ones, to drinke, a Cup of cold Water onely, in the name of a Diſciple, verily I ſay vnto you, he ſhall not loſe his reward.</hi> Let vs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore delight in ſhewing the workes of mercy, that GOD may delight in vs: and ſuccour the poore Saints that are diſtreſſed, that we alſo our ſelues may finde helpe in time of need.</p>

Firſt of all, of ſuch as think that Hoſpitality conſiſteth in feaſting and keeping great cheere, and bidding the Rich to their Tables: whereas the Scripture vnderſtandeth by it, a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous entertainement of ſuch poore Chriſtians as are banniſhed out of their Countries. They therefore are much deceiued, that commend thoſe to be the onely Houſe-keepers that feede men of all ſorts, without difference and diſcretion, and releeue idle perſons that flocke vnto their Gates, and gather together ſuch as are ſturdy and vagrant to receiue their Almes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the rules of the word, and the Statutes of well-gouerned Common-Wealths. Theſe may be ſaid rather to keepe great houſes, then good hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and to be great Houſe-keepers, rather then good Houſe-keepers. It were more charity to puniſh, then to releeue ſuch vnruly perſons, as wil ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelues to no Lawes, nor liue in any Family or ſociety, to the ende there may be ſufficient for them that are Strangers indeede. And ſuch as wander vp and downe, and are inccorrigible, are no better then Theeues, in as much as they liue by the ſweate of other mens labours, <note n="e" place="margin">2 Theſ. 3, 8, 10.</note> and as idle Drones ſucke away the Hony from the Bees, and deuour that which ſhould maintain the faithfull of the Land, and ſuch as labour the thing that is good. Let ſuch therefore, as haue their affections ready to receiue others into their houſes, and to make them partakers of the bleſsings that God hath beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vpon them, vſe it moſt commonly toward the poore Saints, and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute members of Chriſt; according to the precept of our Sauiour.

               <p>Secondly, this meeteth with the corruption of our times, we cannot abide
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:7222:235" rendition="simple:additions"/> thoſe that are Strangers, but are enemies to the very name when we heare it. But all neglect of them, and iniurious dealing toward them is a great ſinne, and ſuch as are haters of Strangers, are grieuous Sinners. Such <note n="g" place="margin">Gene. 19. Iudg. 19.</note> were the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> ſuch were the men of <hi>Gibeah,</hi> that offered all violence they could, to the Strangers that came to lodge among them; it was an euident ſigne of horrible impiety and iniquity that raigned among them. They that cry out ſo much againſt Strangers, and vſe it as a word of reproach, do ſhew plainelie that they doe not deſerue to be numbred among the Children of God, nor to be accounted as members of Chriſt, any more then Dogs and Swine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as out of their owne mouths they ſhall be iudged. It is a ſhamefull barbarouſneſſe for men to haue pitty and compaſſion on them that are help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. Among the Heathen and Infidels they were euill thought of, that had not this reaſon and vnderſtanding to receiue them gently and peaceably that were caſt out of their houſes and dwellings: how much more is it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for vs, when we ſee the Church of GOD toſſed and tumbled, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by Tyrants and enemies of the truth, to giue courteous entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the poore Chriſtians which are baniſhed out of their Countries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaued of their friends, and ſeparated from their Kinsfolkes, of whom they might be ſuccoured? If we do not theſe thinges, it is an euident token, that we renounce God, and haue no ſparke of true piety in vs. For the Lord doth more rigorouſly condemne the outrages and wrongs that are done to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, then thoſe that are done to a mans owne Neighbours. The Heathen ſhame vs; nay, ſhall riſe vp in iudgement to condemne vs in this behalfe: for when they intended to ſhew that ſome man was of a wicked and ſlauiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they were wont to ſay; <hi>Get thee hence, thou art an Enemy toward Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:</hi> and this checke and taunt was more with them, then if they had bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a man with the Name of an Whore-maiſter, a Drunkard, a periured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a Murtherer, or if they had ſaide; Thou art worſe then a brute Beaſt. They <note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Homer. Odyſſ. lib.</hi> 22.</note> accounted the poore man and the ſtranger to be both ſent vnto vs of God, and therefore ought not to be deſpiſed. They called them to lodge and ſoiourne <note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Virgil. Aeneid. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.</note> with them, and acknowledge that there ought to be a compaſſion of the miſeries one of another. They ſhewed not a niggardly mind, <note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ouid. Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morph. lib.</hi> 8.</note> but a cheerefull looke, and a friendly countenance toward ſuch as they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to their houſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Painims</hi> haue ſpoken and practiſed after this manner: what ſhal then become of vs that profeſſe our ſelues to be Gods Children, when we fight ſo directly againſt the order of nature? For God hath ſet one common and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall band among al mankind, and it is required of vs, to extend our charitie toward all ſuch as reſemble vs, and carry the Image of God vpon them: but eſpecially it behooueth vs to reſpect ſuch as are more neerly knit vnto vs by the band of Faith, and therefore ought to be more deare vnto vs, then all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. True it is, all Strangers are to be warned and admoniſhed for their part, that they abuſe not that name and priuiledge. If a man haue a priuiledge and protection from a Prince, and then abuſe both himſelfe and it, ſo that vnder the colour of that benefit and honor done vnto him, he commit ſome outrage and wicked Act, ſhall he not be worthy of double punniſhment? It falleth out ſometimes, that a great number will ſay, they are driuen out of their Countrey for their conſcience, yet they ſhew a corrupt conſcience, defile the Church with their diſſolute life, &amp; giue occaſion to vnbeleeuers, to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme the purity of doctrine, and to haue their mouthes wide open againſt the profeſſors of it. Notwithſtanding, we muſt take heed, that for the offence of ſome, we do not reiect thoſe that are Gods ſtrangers, that we do not leaue them helpleſſe, but ſuccour them as God hath inabled vs. They are among vs, to try our beneuolence and charity. If we ſhew mercy to them, though they be not able to requite it, yet God is both able and willing to recompence our workes of mercy.</p>

                  <note n="l" place="margin">Gene. 18, 1.</note> who ſate at his Tent doore, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite ſuch as he ſaw paſſing by, and had neede of the fruites of mercy to bee ſhewed vnto them.

This reprooueth thoſe that grudge and are greeued when any occaſion falleth out, that they are tryed what affection and compaſſion they beare vnto them.

                  <hi>Dauid</hi> and his men: for when hee was intreated by the Meſſengers that were ſent vnto him, to giue whatſoeuer came to his hand; he railed at them, and ſent them away empty; he was lauiſh of his tongue, but ſparing of his purſſe; they had words, but they had nothing but wordes. It was otherwiſe with <hi>Abraham:</hi> when he ſaw men come toward him, hee ranne to meete them, he bowed himſelfe vnto them, he intreated them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the meanes of refreſhing themſelues at his handes, he preſſed vppon them very earneſtly, that they ſhould not deny him. To this purpoſe we heard out of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, That we ſhould be harborous without grudging.</hi> We muſt therefore, not onely doe good to Strangers, but doe good cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie, and with a ready minde, without murmuring and repining at the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion offered vnto vs. We now dwell in our owne Countrey, and among our Kindred; we reſt quietly in our Houſes, and in our Beddes; wee liue in peace and quietneſſe; but we know not what daies may ſhine vppon vs, and what times may come ouer our heads. We that now hate and abhorre ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in our owne Land, it may happen, that our ſelues may be Strangers in a Land that is not our owne. <hi>Moſes,</hi> exhorting the people of Iſraell to be mercifull toward ſuch, as aboue all others ſtand in neede of mercy; to wit, Strangers, Widdowes, and fatherloſſe Children; maketh this as a reaſon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; <hi>Loue the Stranger, for ye were Strangers in the Land of Aegipt.</hi> And albeit this reaſon doe not hold in many of vs, neyther can be perſwaded to deale kindly with Strangers, becauſe we haue beene already Strangers: yet this Argument may be alleadged vnto vs, to be carefull to loue Straungers, becauſe we our ſelues may be ſtrangers in another Land. For we know not where we ſhall end our daies, or in what manner, any more then when wee ſhall dye, which all of vs know to be vncertaine. If then we be hard-harted vnto others, we muſt not looke to finde others pittifull to our ſelues. It is Gods will, that we ſhould be Strangers in this World; as appeareth by the example and confeſsion of the faithfull. Heb. 11. 9. 10, 13. <hi>By Faith Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham abode in the Land of Promiſe, as in a ſtrange Countrey, as one that dwelt in Tents with Iſaac and Iacob, Heires with him of the ſame Promiſe: for he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for a Cittie hauing a Foundation, whoſe bulder and maker is GOD.</hi> Thus did all the godly caſt vp their accounts, and confeſſed that they were Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Pilgrims on the Earth; yea, we are his Children vpon other condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Lord is in Heauen, and we liue vpon the earth, yet he commeth downe vnto vs, and gouerneth vs; he ſheweth that he hath not forgotten vs, but giueth vs an example what pitty we ought to haue of them that fly vnto vs, as poore ſheepe that are ſcattered by rauenous Wolues; we ſhould deale with them, as we would haue the Lord deale with vs, and ſhew that mercy that we expect of him.</p>
               <p>True it is, the Apoſtle noteth it among the properties required of the Paſtour and Miniſter, <note n="o" place="margin">1 Tim. 3, 2. Tit. 1, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>That hee ſhould be giuen to Hospitality:</hi> but he meant it alſo in generall, to all the faithfull; howbeit the Miniſters muſt ſhewe
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:7222:236"/> them the way, and hold out the Candle to giue them light. For his purpoſe is not to binde the Miniſters onely to beware of intemperancy, to fly Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, to auoyde Pride: and on the other ſide, to moue them onely to be iuſt, ſober, curteous, chaſt, and harborous; in the meane ſeaſon, leauing all others to doe what they would, and liue as they lift. <note n="p" place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſons why generall duties are appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.</note> But the Apoſtle ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them out by themſelues, and chargeth theſe duties vpon them: firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the word of God ſhould not be euill ſpoken off by the enemies, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſuch ſcandals and faults to be in them. Secondly, to the end they ſhould approoue their Doctrine by their good life, and ratifie it to the conſciences of all that heare it, and ſo make it better welcome to them, and them more willing to embrace it. Thirdly, that the people ſhould follow them, and frame their liues according to thoſe vertues and graces which they ſee in their Shepheards. And by the way let vs note, that if chiefely among others, the Miniſter muſt be harborous, and it be a vertue that commendeth him to the Church to be giuen to Hoſpitality, then the meanes ſhould bee cheerefully and plentifully affoorded vnto him, that he may be fitted and inabled to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it.

If we were rich &amp; noble, if were Kings and Princes, if we haue had thouſandes that haue required and receiued mercy from vs, yet a time ſhall come, when we ſhall ſtande at the Iudgement ſeate of the Almighty, and call for mercy at his hands.

On the other ſide, haue we ſeene the Saintes of God ſicke, and not viſited them? Strangers, and not harboured them? Hungry, and not fed them?

Thus ſhall it bee with all that are enemies to the diſtreſſed Saintes, that are conſtrained to wander without any certaine dwelling, as poore ſtraungers, from place to place to ſaue their liues, with loſſe of their Liuings: God ſhall meaſure out to them, as they haue meaſured to others, then ſhal they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne their folly that is paſt, and repent of their Crueltie, when it is too late.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 3.</note> Thirdly, his promiſe goeth with our prayers, he cannot deny the wordes of his owne mouth, nor fruſtrate that which once he hath ſpoken. It is that which the Prophet mentioneth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50, 15. <hi>Call vpon me in the day of trouble, ſo will I deliuer thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me.</hi> Heere we haue a Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to call on God; we haue a promiſe &amp; aſſurance to be heard: we muſt performe the condition, to glorifie him that hath heard vs. To diſobey the Commandement, is horrible Rebellion; to diſtruſt the promiſe, is monſtrous Infidelity; to refuſe the condition, is vile ingratitude and vnthankfulneſſe. This promiſe is alſo laid before vs by Chriſt himſelfe. <hi>Math.</hi> 7, 7, 8. <hi>Aske, and it ſhall be giuen you; ſeeke, and ye ſhall finde; knocke, and it ſhall bee opened vnto you; for whoſoeuer asketh, receiueth; and he that ſeeketh, findeth; &amp; to him

If we had no promiſe, there could ariſe in our hearts nothing but fearing and doubting; nothing but terror and diſcoragement. So then, whether we conſider, that the prayers of the people of God are as pleaſant Muſicke to delight him, or as a ſtrong weapon to enforce him, or as a ſure building ſetled vpon the Rock of his promiſe, we may ſafely conclude, that they are very auaileable to helpe vs and others, when as they proceede from an humble and faithfull heart, which giueth life and quickening vnto them.</p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1</note> Let vs ſee the Vſes that naturally ariſe from hence. Firſt, it teacheth vs, that if prayer be ſo auaileable, we ought to learne what prayer is. Manie there are, that know the Commandement of God, that he requireth this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at their hands; they ſee what they ſhould doe, who yet are altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in the right manner of the doing of it. They come to this worke as to an ordinary matter, they performe it of cuſtome, they make it a Lippe-labour, they come without feeling of the Maieſty of God, or their owne wants. We muſt therefore vnderſtand, that to pray, is to put vp our requeſts to God, according to his will, from a contrite heart in the name of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, with aſſurance to be heard.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The firſt thing required in Prayer.</note> In which deſcription of Prayer, there is offered to our conſiderations, theſe fiue thinges: Firſt, that it is a putting vp, and powring out of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts to God: <hi>For</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 10, 14</note> 
                  <hi>how ſhall we call vpon him in whom wee doe not beleeue?</hi> And as he only is to be beleeued in, ſo he onely knoweth our conditions, &amp; heareth our cries, and ſeeth our neceſſities. It is therefore our dutie to ſeeke vnto him in our miſery, and to make him a Tower of refuge to reſort vnto. This the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> teacheth, Chap. 17, 7. <hi>At that day ſhall a man looke to his Maker, and his eyes ſhall looke to the holy one of Iſraell.</hi> Wee muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that it is not left in our owne choiſe to pray, or not to pray; we haue an expreſſe Commandement, <hi>After this manner pray ye.</hi> And againe, <hi>Pray continually.</hi> Let them therefore bee aſhamed, that make no care or Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to pray, and ſuch as cannot pray at all. Theſe two may well be ioyned together, and are brethren in euill, and Companions in wickedneſſe. For Prayer is a guift beſtowed vppon all the faithful, in ſome meaſure. Some haue this bleſſed grace in a greater degree, and ſome in a leſſe; but al are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with it in ſome ſort, none do wholly want it, that want not the ſpirit. Hence it is, that we read of the <note n="l" place="margin">Zach. 12, 10.</note> Spirit of ſupplications. <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Daniell</hi> were often in the practiſe of this duty, and fayled not three times a day to humble themſelues in the preſence of God. There is no man ſo ſimple and ſottiſh, but knoweth how to aske a benefit when he wanteth it: he can aske for bread, when he lacketh it: he can craue drinke, when he is thirſty: he can craue apparrell when we would be cloathed. We ſee the practiſe of this in little Children, they are quickly brought to do this: and yet I feare mee, the greateſt part of men, neither deſire, nor know how to deſire any thing at the hands of God, who is a liberall rewarder of all that come vnto him, and call vpon him. They can begge of men, but they haue no knowledge to put vp any ſupplication to God.</p>
               <p>If a Prince ſhould ſet out an Edict, and make a Proclamation, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer would come and make humble ſute vnto him, ſhould haue ſuch a faire Lordſhip or rich Manour, there are few that would miſſe it for want of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: no man would want words, all men would be eloquent enough, there would be ſuters and ſuppliants great ſtore, that would make their tongues ſerue them ripely and readily for ſuch a purpoſe. Thus it is between God &amp; vs, he hath publiſhed, that <note n="m" place="margin">Ioel 2, 32. Rom. 10, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Whoſoeuer shall call vpon the name of the Lorde, shall be ſaued:</hi> Let vs not now be wanting to our ſelues, nor loſe a kingdom
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:7222:239" rendition="simple:additions"/> for want of asking. If we aske for grace and glory, we ſhall obtaine. That which we would doe for a temporall poſſeſſion, let vs not leaue vndone to obtaine an heauenly inheritance; and if we would goe vnto men, let vs not neglect or omit to pray vnto God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The ſecond thing required in prayer.</note> The ſecond thing to be obſerued in the right inuocation of the name of God, is that it muſt be offered vp according to his word and will. We are not left at our owne liberty, and our voluntary choiſe how we will pray, the manner preſcribed, allowed, and accepted of God, is when it is done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his owne will. He will be worſhipped according to his owne appointment, and not as we pleaſe. This was taught vs before, out of the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn,</hi> Chap. 5, 14. <hi>This is the aſſurance that we haue in him, that if wee aske any thing according to his will, he heareth vs.</hi> He doth not promiſe, that whatſoeuer we craue, we ſhall receiue; and whatſoeuer we aske, wee ſhall obtaine; but he reſtraineth the promiſe, <hi>Whatſoeuer we ſhall aske according to his will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This therefore, is the right manner of praying, to pray according to his will, that commandeth this duty of vs. We muſt craue of him ſuch thinges as he alloweth, and not luſt after the things that he hateth and forbiddeth. This being the rule of Prayer (that is ſhortly ſet downe) doth direct vs in all our ſupplications to ſeeke to know his will, &amp; then to ſubmit our ſelues vnto it, if we would pray with fruit and profit. We ſee among men this order ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, that ſuch as deſire to obtaine the fauor and helpe of other, do frame themſelues wholly vnto their will. So ought it to be with vs, if wee woulde haue God to reſpect vs, and heare vs, we muſt faſhion our ſelues according to his pleaſure, otherwiſe we deceiue our ſelues, if we hope for any bleſsing at his hands. Now the will of God directing our prayers, conſiſteth in three things. Firſt, that our bodies and ſoules be no otherwiſe ſetled, then becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth thoſe that are to enter talke and communication with God. This the faithfull declared, by lifting vp their handes, by caſting vp the eies, by bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe the knees, and ſuch other geſtures, as teſtified the ſequeſtring of all their thoughts from the earth and earthly cogitations, and the bringing of all their mind to the meditation of heauen and heauenly things. Secondly, we haue need in prayer, of perſeuerance &amp; continuance. Wee muſt not giue ouer, and wax weary. It pleaſeth the Lord oftentimes to defer to heare &amp; to helpe vs, not that he neglecteth vs, or forgetteth vs, or wiſheth our hurt, but to exerciſe our Faith by delaying. Wherefore all raſh preſumption ought to be far from vs, which dareth to preſcribe vnto God, either the time, or the maner of our deliuerance, and of granting our requeſts. It is our duty to wait patiently vpon the Lord, and to refer vnto him the meanes and maner of hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of vs. The woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Math. 15, 22.</note> is a notable example to teach vs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in prayer, euen then when wee ſeeme to haue the repulſe and deniall. The Widdow in the Goſpell is a <note n="o" place="margin">Luke 18, 1, 2</note> worthy preſident to this purpoſe, to moue vs to this perſeuerance, and not to giue ouer. Laſtly, we muſt beware, that we aske no more then God giueth vs leaue to aske in his word. We muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire thoſe things that are fitting vs to craue, and beſeeming God to grant. Many men neuer conſider theſe things, but are raſh and heady in their peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, regarding neither what he in goodneſſe and Iuſtice can giue, neither what is profitable for themſelues to receiue. Some craue riches to ſpend in luſt and riot: other wiſh for ſtrength to be reuenged of their enimies, <note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 12, 21</note> whom they ought to receiue with goodneſſe. Others are not aſhamed to ask foule and filthy things, which one would bluſh to aske of a mortal man, which the Heathen <note n="q" place="margin">Perſ. Satyr. 2.</note> themſelues haue condemned. Theſe are the cauſes why our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are not heard, becauſe we aske amiſſe, and do not ſubmit our willes to his will. Our wils are carnall and corrupt: his will is pure and holy, and the rule of all righteouſneſſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The 3. thing required in prayer.</note> The third point to be obſerued in prayer, is, that it proceed from an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and contrite heart. If pride do compaſſe vs as a Chain, and an high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of our ſelues poſſeſſe vs, we are deceiued if we ſuppoſe to obtaine anie thing at the hands of God. A proud Begger is hated of God, and ſcorned of men. There can nothing be ſeene more deformed and deſpiſed, then a poor man that is proud. There is nothing can worſe ſort together, then a proude heart, and a beggers purſe. God euer-more reſiſteth the proud, and giueth grace vnto the humble and lowly. The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> declareth this <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51, 16, 17. <hi>Thou deſireſt no Sacrifice, though I would giue it: thou delightest not in Burnt Offerings. The Sacrifices of God are a contrite spirite, a contrite and a broken heart, O Lord, thou wilt not deſpiſe.</hi> We muſt learne therefore truely to feele our owne pouerty and miſery: let vs conſider that we neede all things that we aske, and ſo ioyne an earneſt and feruent affection and deſire of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining. Indeed, wee cannot alwayes haue a like feeling, but wee muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſtriue againſt deadneſſe of heart, and dulneſſe of ſpirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let vs ſhake off all vaine-glory and pride, and giue all the glory to God, as the poore Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can did in the Goſpell. Thus haue the faithfull done, <note n="r" place="margin">Pſal. 143, 2. Dan. 6, 17. Eſay 64, 5. Ier. 14, 7.</note> as appeareth in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, Daniell, Eſay, Ieremy.</hi> We muſt not bee like the proud Phariſie, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Luke 16, 11.</note> that ſtood vpon his owne righteouſneſſe, and condemned other of wickedneſſe and prophaneneſſe. Let vs alſo come with Repentaunce, not onely cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing pardon for ſins paſt, and making an humble Confeſſion of faults pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but deſiring grace to be ſtrengthned in time to come.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, let not our prayer be a lip-labour for forme and faſhion ſake, but earneſt and feruent. When <hi>Saneherib</hi> inuaded <hi>Iudah,</hi> and beſieged the ſtrong Citties, and thought to win them for him-ſelfe, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> with him <note n="t" place="margin">2 Chr. 32, 20</note> cried to heauen. Thus doth the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſpeake, <note n="u" place="margin">Lam. 2, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, cry in the night; in the beginning of the Watches, poure out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord lift vp thine hands toward him, &amp;c.</hi> Heerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to accordeth the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 26, 27. <hi>The ſpirit helpeth our infirmities, for we know not how to pray as we ought: but the ſpirit it ſelfe maketh requeſt for vs with ſights, which cannot be expreſſed: but he that ſearcheth the hearts, knoweth what is the meaning of the ſpirit; for he maketh requeſt for the Saints according to the will of God.</hi> Thus it appeareth out of the practiſe of the Prophets &amp; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, what kinde of prayers God accepteth. True it is, they auaile much, howbeit they muſt be feruent. Cold prayers turne into ſinne, and neuer bring with them any bleſſing. We will ſeeme to drawe neere to God, and to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor him, howbeit it is only with our mouths and lips, which is a vaine woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of him. We will needs cal vpon his name, but our prayers freeze be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene our teeth, and are vttered without zeale. Theſe are they that pray, but it is in ſuch ſort, as if they neuer meant to ſpeed. If a Child ſhould craue any thing of his parents in that manner, they would take them-ſelues to bee abuſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The fourth thing required in prayer.</note> The 4. thing expreſſed in the former deſcription of praier, is, that it muſt be put vp in the name of Chriſt Ieſus. He is the Mediator of the new Teſtament, he ſtandeth between the wrath of his Father &amp; vs; he maketh continuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for vs. If then, we would haue our prayers accepted, we muſt come in his name, he is the High-prieſt of our profeſſion, he offereth them vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Father, who accepteth them not for their woorthineſſe, but for his worthineſſe; not for their merits, but for his merits; as wee ſhall ſhew far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Doctrine following. In his Name, did the Fathers come to the Throne of Grace, and preſented their prayers before God, aſſuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to bee heard for his ſake. This is manifeſt in the prayer that <hi>Daniell</hi> maketh, Chap. 9. 17. <hi>Now therefore (O our God) hear the Prayer of thy ſeruant, and his ſupplications, and cauſe thy face to shine vppon thy Sanctuary that lyeth wast, for the Lords ſake.</hi> He acknowledgeth Chriſt Ieſus to be the heire and

Wee cannot aske in our owne name, <note n="u" place="margin">Ferus in Ioh. 16.</note> that is; for our owne merits any thing: we ask and obtaine in the name of Chriſt. By his name we muſt vnderſtand his incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his paſsion, his death, his deſerts, his interceſsion. For, as he that hath Chriſt, hath eternall life, becauſe Chriſt <hi>is the way, the trueth, and the life;</hi> ſo he that hath Chriſt, obtaineth all things, becauſe he it is alone in whom the Father is well pleaſed. It is therefore a lawfull and laudable cuſtom of the true Church, to conclude and ſhut vp their prayers in the name of Chriſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring thereby, that their truſt and confidence to be heard, ſtandeth not in themſelues, nor in any other then the Mediatour betweene God and them. True it is, the Church of Rome vſeth this form, and endeth in his name, but this is no better then a meere mocking of Chriſt. For, albeit they adde in the cloſing vp of their prayers, <hi>Through our Lord Ieſus Christ;</hi> yet the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of them is full of Idolatry, and the Saints are made Idols, and Chriſt a Mediator to bring vs to them, which is as foule a diſhonour, as if the eldeſt ſonne, who is heire of al, ſhould be vſed and employed to bring vs into the fauour of the ſeruant of the houſe. So then, we muſt holde it as a principle of our Faith to direct vs in our prayers, that they be not made in the name of any creature, but in the name and mediation of Chriſt alone. And heereby is diſcouered a manifeſt fault and palpable error of ignorant people. They powre out many Prayers, and cry out oftentimes, <hi>Lord helpe me, Lorde haue mercie vpon me,</hi> Thus doe theſe poore and ſimple blind ſoules, ruſh vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Lord, as it were into the Chamber of preſence, without a guide: they know not the nature of God, that he is as well a moſt fearefull iudge, as a moſt mercifull father: and they are ignoraunt of the Office of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, in whoſe name they ſhould preſent their prayers to him. Hee that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in his owne name, commeth in a wrong name; and he that commeth without Chriſt, departeth without fruite. Hee ſprinkleth our prayers with the ſweete Odours of his merits and mediation, without which, our prayers and our perſons are abhominable.</p>

Whoſoeuer doubteth whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God will graunt his requeſts or not, can neuer pray for any thing ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and effectually. This our Sauiour teacheth, <hi>Marke</hi> 11, 24. <hi>Whatſoeuer ye deſire when ye pray, beleeue that ye ſhall haue it, and it ſhall bee done vnto you.</hi> None can haue this perſwaſion to be heard, none can haue this affiance, that God is both willing and able to helpe them, but the faithfull, who haue aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that their ſinnes are pardoned, and their perſonnes reconciled vnto God in Chriſt. Such as ſtand in doubt of this, can neuer beleeue anie other promiſes reuealed in the word, nor be ſure that any of his prayers ſhall bee heard. If any come and make any ſuite or ſupplication vnto vs, whom wee know to doubt of our good will and meaning toward vs, can wee regarde them, or accept of them? So they can by no meanes pleaſe God, that while they are praying, doubt of his good meaning, or Almighty power, and know not how he is affected and diſpoſed toward them. For this cauſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Iames</hi> directing vs in the right courſe of prayer, commandeth rhat it be made in faith without doubting, <hi>Iames</hi> 1, 6, 7. <hi>Let him aske in Faith, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer not: for he that wauereth, is like a waue of the Sea toſſed of the wind, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away: neither let that man thinke that he ſhall receiue any thing of the Lord.</hi>
                  <pb n="453" facs="tcp:7222:240"/> It is a great corruption of the fleſh, and ſuch as ſpringeth from the bitter root of Infidelity, to imagine that God doeth not, or will not regarde our prayers, according to that ſaying of the Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10, 13. <hi>Wherefore doth the wicked contemne God? He ſaith in his heart, Thou wilt not regard.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection</note> But heere ſome may Obiect &amp; ſay; How can we haue this aſſurance, ſeeing many pray, and yet receiue not; they aske, and obtaine not. The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth, <note n="y" place="margin">Pſal. 22, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>O my God, I cry by day, but thou hearest not; and by night, but haue no audience.</hi> And in another place, <note n="z" place="margin">2 Sam. 12, 14</note> 
                  <hi>He prayed for the life of his child with great earnestneſſe of ſpirit, with great humbleneſſe of mind, with great anguiſh of hart,</hi> and yet he obtained not the life of his ſonne that he deſired, <hi>for the Child di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> I anſwere to this many waies. Firſt, God doth ſometimes deferre to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere his ſeruants, to make them cry more earneſtly. We are made of a dull Mettall, we quickly wax weary in prayer; we muſt haue ſome means to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle our zeale. Now, it is a great error in the faithfull, to thinke that GOD deceyueth vs, becauſe hee delayeth vs; it is the purpoſe of God to try vs for the exerciſe of our faith, and the encreaſe of our zeale.</p>
               <p>Secondly, men doe ſometimes pray that are prophane, and lye in ſome greeuous ſinne, that is vnrepented of, which is as a thicke cloude ſtanding betweene the Lord and vs, and as it were ſtopping his eares, that he cannot heare vs: or as a barre that lyeth in our way, that we cannot poſsibly come into the preſence of God. True Repentance wil ſcatter the Cloud, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue the barre that is before vs; but till ſinne bee forſaken, <note n="a" place="margin">Iohn 9, 31.</note> our Prayers cannot bee graunted. Many complaine that they are not heard, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure that they ſpend their wordes as in the Winde; but they neuer conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what the cauſe is, and where the fault lyeth, and how it is to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they pray to ſatisfie their luſts, and do not aske ſuch thinges as they ought to deſire, according as the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> vpbraydeth the Iewes to whom he wrote, <note n="b" place="margin">Iames 4, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye aske and receiue not, becauſe ye ask amiſſe, that ye might lay the ſame out on your pleaſures.</hi> It is not enough to craue good thinges, but we muſt aske them to a good end. If our purpoſe be euill, our Prayers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be good, our requeſts cannot be granted.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we muſt pray for earthly things, with condition, ſo farre as they may ſerue to the glory of God, and our owne good: and therefore, we muſt refer our ſelues wholy to his will and pleaſure, as we are taught in the Lords Prayer to ſay; <hi>Thy will be done.</hi> Spirituall Graces we may aske without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, but earthly benefits with limitation.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, God heareth our prayers two wayes. Firſt, when he granteth that thing which we aske. Thus he heard <hi>Iſaac, Moſes, Hezekiah, Iehoſhaphat,</hi> &amp; others. Secondly, albeit God do not beſtow vpon vs alwaies thoſe lawfull things which we deſire and demand, yet he heareth our prayers, and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth our cries, when he giueth ſome thing proportionable to that we ask: As if we craue earthly bleſſings, he giueth vs heauenly; and if we craue tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things, he yeeldeth eternal life; and if, inſtead of deliuerance of vs out of trouble, he giueth vs ſtrength and ability to beare trouble, and patience to endure vnder the croſſe without murmuring. Thus is Chriſt ſaid to be <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 5, 7.</note> heard in that which he feared, albeit he ſuffered death. He prayed that the <hi>Cuppe might paſſe from him,</hi> yet he was to drinke of it; his Father had decreed it, he had vndertaken it, and we were to be <note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor. 12, 8, 9</note> redeemed by it. Notwithſtanding, he was heard when God gaue him ſtrength to beare it, and ſent an Angel to comfort him in his Agony, according to that he ſpeaketh, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11, 41, 42. <hi>Father I thank thee, becauſe thou hast heard me, I know that thou hearest me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So when <hi>Paule</hi> felt a pricke in the Fleſh, the Meſſenger of Sathan to buffet him; for this thing hee beſought the Lord thrice, that it might <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:7222:241"/> from him,</hi> and he ſaide vnto him, <hi>My Grace is ſufficient for thee, for my power is made perfect through weakneſſe.</hi> God did not heare him, and yet hee did heare him. He requeſteth one thing, and God graunteth him another. He craueth freedome from tentation, but he is promiſed a ſupply of grace to be made able to ouercome tentations. Thus it fareth with euerie one of vs; we muſt conſider what we aske, and how God heareth vs. Wee muſt not thinke he forgetteth vs, when he doth not feed our fanſies, and anſwere our expectations: he knoweth what is beſt for vs, and he will giue vs that which he ſeeth to be beſt for vs.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 2</note> Secondly, as this Doctrine ſendeth vs to ſchoole to learne what true prayer is, ſo it ſerueth to reprooue three ſorts of men. Firſt, ſuch as are growne to this height of prophaneſſe, that they thinke it to bee in vaine to pray vnto God. The faithfull finde by a bleſſed experience of Gods fauor, that nothing is more profitable vnto them. They woulde rather leaue any earthly Commoditie, and looſe their liues, then ceaſe to call vppon the Name of God. Wee ſee this in the example of <hi>Daniell,</hi> Chapter 6. 7, 8. when a Decree was confirmed, ſealed, and publiſhed, according to the Law of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Dan. 6, 7, 8.</note> which altereth not, <hi>That whoſoeuer ſhall aske a petition of any God or Man for thirtie daies, ſaue of the King, he ſhould be cast into the Denne of Lyons.</hi> It might ſeeme no great matter to forbeare and abſtaine from prayer for ſo ſhort a time, yet when <hi>Daniell</hi> vnderſtood, that the writing was paſſed and publiſhed, hee went into his houſe, and his win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow being open in his Chamber toward <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> hee kneeled vppon his Knees three times in a day, and prayed and praiſed his God, as hee did afore-time.</p>
               <p>It is therefore a Teſtimony of a very prophane and proud heart, not onely not to pray, but to contemne and abhorre it as an vnclean thing, or as a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous and needleſſe thing. Thus doeth <hi>Iob</hi> bring in the vngodlie ſpeaking, who differ but one ſteppe from Atheiſtes, the deareſt and beſt beloued ſonnes of the Deuill, Chapt. 21. <note n="f" place="margin">Iob 21, 14, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>They ſay alſo vnto GOD; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from vs, for wee deſire not the knowledge of thy wayes: Who is the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that wee ſhould ſerue him? And what profite should wee haue, if wee ſhoulde pray vnto him?</hi> Ah, vile Wretches, whether will your blaſphemous mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes reach? Will you thus bee at defiance with the moſt high and Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent GOD, and ſet your ſelues againſt Heauen? Whereas wee are ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes allured and prouoked to prayer, and haue moſt gracious and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes added, that God will heare vs? Shall we bidde him battell (as if we were ſtronger then hee) and ſay; If wee crie vnto him Day and Night, what do we gaine, or what aduantage ſhall growe vnto vs? Do not they proſper alike, that neuer haue God in their mindes, and they that frequent diligently and daily the houſe of Prayer? Who are more ſubiect to troubles, then ſuch as trouble themſelues with the word of God, and ſtudie to keepe his commandements? Wherefore, whether we pray, or not pray, al is one, all is alike, there is no difference, we looſe our labor, wee receiue no profit. Thus do many ſpeake, thus do <note n="g" place="margin">Eccles. 9, 2. Mal. 13, 14.</note> mo thinke; the world is full of ſuch vermine and venome. Againſt which moſt wicked imaginations, wee muſt oppoſe the commandement of God willing vs to pray, the promiſe of mercy, the examples of the faithfull, which haue bin heard when they prayed. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, this Doctrine reprooueth ſuch as goe to Saints and Angelles; from the Creator to the Creature, which is a great diſhonour done to God, and a reproach to Chriſt. Were not hee a fooliſh and ſottiſh ſuppliant, that when the Kings ſonne offereth to ſpeake for him to his father, would refuſe to vſe his mediation, and goe to one of his ſeruants to entreat for him? Is it not meete that ſuch a one ſhould be ſaide nay, and depart without his purpoſe? Euen ſo, inaſmuch as the father ſendeth vs vnto his ſonne, and the ſonne
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:7222:241"/> calleth vs to himſelfe, what madneſſe is it to runne as well from the one, as from the other, to go from the ſonne to the Saints; from him that can hear, to them that cannot helpe? Nay, as the Father is depriued of his Honour, and the ſonne robbed of his Office, ſo the Saints themſelues are diſgraced. If a man ſhould ſet any of the Subiectes downe in the Chaire of eſtate, and then bowe downe before him, and giue him any of the Royalties of the King, were not this high Treaſon againſt the Prince, and extreame wrong to the Subiect? Thus the caſe ſtandeth betweene vs, God, and the Saintes. If wee ſhall aduance the Saintes to ſo high a degree, as to pray vnto them, which is proper vnto God, and (as it were) the Princes Regality; if they did ſee our impiety, they would bluſh at it, and be aſhamed of it. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> would not ſuffer <hi>Cornelius</hi> 
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Acts 10, 25.</note> when he met him, to fall downe at his feet and worſhip him. <hi>Paule</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> rent their cloths, <note n="i" place="margin">Act 14, 13, 14</note> when they ſaw <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piters</hi> Prieſt bring Bulles with Garlands vnto the gates of the Citty, to the end they might offer ſacrifice vnto them. Did they reiect this ſeruice done vnto them when they liued vpon the earth, and ſhal we think they doe now affect it, or would now accept of it? Away therefore, with the mediation of the Angels, who know not our hearts, nor hear our prayers. Away with the mediation of the Saints, who beeing now in heauen, are accepted of God, not for themſelues, but for the precious merits of their Sauiour Chriſt. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept not the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> his Mother, but as once <hi>ſhee reioyced in God her Sauiour,</hi> ſo now ſhe triumpheth in Chriſt her Redeemer, and is accepted through the deſerts of her ſonne. To conclude this point, let vs remember the ſaying of the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn,</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="margin">1 Iohn 2, 1.</note> 
                  <hi>If any man ſinne, we haue an Aduocate with the Father, Ieſus Christ the righteous, and he is the reconciliation for our ſinnes.</hi> Where we ſee, he ioyneth theſe two together, to bee an Aduocate, and to make reconciliation, and appropriateth them both to the perſon of Chriſt. If then, the Saints be our Aduocates, that wee ſhould preſent our prayers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; they to Chriſt, and Chriſt to God; they muſt alſo make reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our ſinnes, and appeaſe the wrath of God the father, which is vnpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to do, and blaſphemous for vs to affirme. It is our duty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to repair &amp; reſort vnto God the father through the merits of his ſon Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. The Prophet complaineth, <note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 20, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>That ſome trust in Chariots, &amp; ſome in horſes.</hi> So in time of troble, ſome ſeeke to Saints &amp; Angels, <note n="m" place="margin">Leuit. 19, 31 Eſa. 8, 19. &amp; 17 8. &amp; 44, 17, 18</note> others flye to Witches &amp; Idols, <hi>but we must remember the name of the Lord our God.</hi> But of this point we haue ſpoken before more at large. Thirdly, it reproueth ſuch as ſee the want of many bleſſings in themſelues and others, &amp; feel great iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and publick calamities vpon themſelues &amp; others, and yet pray not at all to haue the one beſtowed, and the other remoued. Theſe are like to brute beaſts, that rore &amp; cry out for their prey when they want meat, but they neuer conſider from whence they receiue it; and as the ſwine that eat the Maſt in the woods, but neuer look vp to the tree from whence it falleth: or as the dog that biteth the ſtone that is caſt at him, but looks not to the hand that threw it. So do theſe men; they can mourne and murmure when they ſuſtaine any loſſe, feele any plague, or finde any want; but they haue no knowledge to ſearch out the cauſe or the meanes how Gods bleſſings ſhould be obtained, or his iudgements be preuented. Hence it is, that the Prophets complaine of this ſenceleſneſſe and want of feeling of Gods mercie, and our owne mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, as we ſee in <hi>Ezekiell,</hi> and in other places, <note n="n" place="margin">Ezek. 22, 30. Eſay 59, 16. &amp; 63, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>I ſought for a Man among them, that ſhould not make vp the hedge, and stand in the gappe before the Land, that I ſhould not destroy it, but I found none.</hi> It is a vaine thing for a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician to know the Diſeaſe, and not to apply the Remedie; ſo likewiſe is it a great folly for vs to knowe our owne wantes, and yet to want Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to take a right courſe to redreſſe the ſame. What deadneſſe of heart hath entred into vs, that we haue forgotten the commandements of God, and
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:7222:242"/> cannot remember the examples of his ſeruantes that haue obtained great things at his hands, and cannot be encouraged by his manifolde and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full promiſes that he hath made vnto vs? Let vs then bee prouoked to this dutie, and not be wanting vnto our ſelues, but reſpect our owne good and benefit in ſeeking vnto the Lord daily, in calling vpon him earely and late. The ſeruants of <hi>Naaman</hi> reproue him, in that being commanded an eaſie and ready way to be cured and clenſed of his Leproſie, yet hee hung backe, and would not vſe the remedy, <note n="o" place="margin">2 King. 5, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>If the Prophet</hi> (ſay they to their Maiſter) <hi>hadde commanded thee a greater thing, wouldeſt thou not haue done it? How much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then, when he ſaith to thee, waſh, and be cleane?</hi> So may it be ſaid to vs, to ſhake off our drowſineſſe, and to worke forwardneſſe in vs to practiſe this duty, If the Lord in our preſent wants ſhould require at our hands any hard and difficult thing, ought wee not to obey him, and to performe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement? How much more then, when hee reſpecteth our weakeneſſe, and ſaith onely; <hi>Aske, and you ſhall haue; ſeeke, and ye ſhall finde; knocke, and it ſhall be opened vnto you.</hi> We ſhall not need now to ſay in our owne hearts, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into Heauen, or deſcend into the deepe, to bring his bleſſings vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs from thence.</hi> The remedie is at hand, the meanes are neere euen in our mouth, and in our heart; this is <hi>the prayer of faith, which auaileth much if it be feruent.</hi> It teacheth vs the way to the Lords treaſures, &amp; to put our hand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Cofers, to take ſuch benefits as we want, and to put vp the arrowes of his wrath into his quiuer, which he hath drawn againſt vs, to ſhoot at vs.</p>

For, are the prayers of good men auayleable for our good? Do they procure bleſſinges, and ſtay iudgements? Then haue wee great cauſe to reioyce, and matter of great ioy offered vnto vs in the diligent practiſe of this duty. We are aſſured, that the Lord will not defraud &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs, but giue vs thoſe things that we deſire, and he knoweth what we want. Is our Faith weake? He will ſtrengthen vs. Are we ignorant? He wil enſtruct vs. Doe we want the Graces of his ſpirit? He will ſupply them. Is our Loue cold? He will quicken it. Is our Repentance vnperfect? Hee will perfect it. On the other ſide, are his Iudgements among vs? He will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue them. Are we in diſtreſſe? He will haue mercie vppon vs. Doe our ſinnes trouble vs?

He will deliuer vs. If the conſideration of this gracious dealing of God, and the performance of his precious promiſes, doe not put life into our dead hearts, and aſſure comfort to our feeble ſpirits, and raiſe vs vp when we are caſt downe: what weapon can be of ſufficient force to pierce our hearts, and to driue vs to the Conſcionable practiſe of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? If we had not a bleſſed experience of Gods goodneſſe towards vs, wee ſhould haue the leſſe ſinne to doubt thereof. But ſeeing there is no faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Man or Woman, who hath not found the Lord readie to heare him in time of his need, and that we are compaſſed about with ſo great a Cloude of witneſſes, let vs comfort our ſelues, and one another in theſe things, and bee ſtirred vp to call vpon his name.</p>

It is a note of an vnthankefull heart, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a benefit, and not to acknowledge it; to receiue a guift, and not to praiſe and commend the giuer. This is it which the Apoſtle teacheth, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 9, 10, 11. ſpeaking of the afflictions which came vpon him in <hi>Aſia,</hi> whereby hee was preſſed out of meaſure, paſſing ſtrength, ſo that he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted altogether, euen of life, <hi>We receiued the ſentence of death in our ſelues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

A point worthy to be conſidered of vs, and a duty needfull to bee performed by vs. As he hath promiſed, and we haue prayed: ſo when he hath payed, hee is to be praiſed. Praiſe is comely, and well becommeth the Saintes of God, the want whereof, taketh away the comfort and ſweete fruite of his bleſſinges from vs. It is a great offence to be vnthankefull vnto men, but farre greater to God, in whom we liue, and moue, and haue our being.

The guifts of God beſtowed vpon his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, come from his free grace, not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our deſerts.</note> From hence wee learne, that the guifts of God beſtowed vppon his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, come from his free grace, not from our deſerts; from his mercie, not from our merites: from his Goodneſſe, not from our Worthineſſe. This is ſet downe in the ſecond Commaundement of the Lawe, <hi>Exodus</hi> 20, 6. where the Lorde promiſeth eternall life vnto the Keepers of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, yet they muſt not looke to obtaine it as a due deſert, <hi>For hee will ſhew Mercie vnto thouſandes to them that loue him, and keepe his Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</hi> Faith is an excellent guift, and a notable meanes to bring vs to eternall life, <note n="t" place="margin">Iohn 3, 36.</note> 
                  <hi>For he that beleeueth in the Sonne hath eternall life, and hee that obeyeth not the Sonne, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of GOD abydeth on him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſee then, the neceſſitie of hauing a liuely Faith, becauſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Chriſt, bringeth with it eternall life: yet it is not for the merite of our Faith, but for the Mercie of God, and the Merit of Chriſt apprehended by Faith, <note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 6, 23.</note> inaſmuch as <hi>Eternall life is the free guift of God.</hi> The like we may ſay of Prayer, we haue a comfortable promiſe, that if we aske, we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue; if we ſeeke, we ſhal finde; not becauſe our Prayers do deſerue accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: and therefore, when <hi>Daniell</hi> prayed vnto God, he confeſſeth that <note n="x" place="margin">Dan. 9, 7, 8, 9</note> 
                  <hi>righteouſneſſe belongeth vnto the Lord, but vnto vs open ſhame, becauſe we haue
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:7222:243"/> ſinned againſt him.</hi> Whereby we gather, that although our prayers are not without effect, yet they preuaile not by any excellency is ſound in them, and therefore he ſaith; <hi>Compaſſion and forgiueneſſe is in the Lord our God, albeit we haue rebelled againſt him.</hi> Thus alſo we might perticularly ſpeake of al the good ordinances of God, and the good duties that proceede from vs, as the ſauing hearing of the word, the fruitfull receiuing of the Sacraments, &amp; ſuch like holy exerciſes of our Religion: inaſmuch as he doth accept them, and is well pleaſed in the performance of them, howbeit not through our worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that doe performe them, but thorough his goodneſſe that doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund them, thorough his mercie that doth approoue them, thorough his promiſe that doth receiue them, and thorough his liberality that doeth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 1.</note> If wee would know the Cauſes and Reaſons why the Graces of God are freely beſtowed vpon vs, and nothing giuen in our deſerts; Firſt, let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that all matter of boaſting is taken from vs, and God will haue the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his owne workes, and the praiſe of his mercie. If he ſhould take anie thing of vs, he ſhould looſe ſo much of his owne glory, and we would bee readie to aſcribe our ſanctification and ſaluation to our owne ſelues. This doth the Apoſtle ſet downe at large in ſundry Epiſtles; for ſpeaking of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> he ſaith, <note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 4, 2. and 23, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>If Abraham were iuſtified by workes, he hath wherein to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, but not with God.</hi> And hauing ſhewed before, that God accepteth of the faithfull, making him iuſt, and without blame, by imputing of Chriſtes righteouſneſſe vnto him, he confirmeth it by the end of Iuſtification, which he maketh to be the glory of God, ſaying; <hi>Where is then the reioyſing? It is excluded. By what Law? Of Workes; Nay, but by the Law of Faith.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay; If we were iuſtified, either by our owne Workes wholly &amp; only, or partly by Faith, and partly by workes, then the glory of our iuſtification ſhould be wholly giuen to our ſelues, or at leaſt not wholly giuen vnto God. To this purpoſe he ſpeaketh in the Epiſtle to the Epheſians, <note n="z" place="margin">Ephe. 2, 8, 9. &amp; 1, 5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>By grace are ye ſaued through Faith, and that not of your ſelues; it is the gift of God, not of works, least any man ſhould boaſt himſelfe.</hi> God will haue the glory of our iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he will be accounted and acknowledged to bee the Iuſtifier and Sauiour of vs; he hath not left vs to iuſtifie our ſelues, nor to be our owne Sauiours, as ſhall better appeare afterward.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 2</note> Secondly, there are no ſuch properties in any mans workes, as that they cannot merit or proceed from any other fountaine then Grace. Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſee <note n="a" place="margin" type="runSum">What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties muſt be found in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes to make them merrito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous.</note> what properties are neceſſarily required in workes, to make them merritorious. Firſt, they muſt be done of a man of himſelfe, &amp; by himſelfe: but we haue nothing of our owne to giue him, but are moſt poore men and meere beggers, and can but pay God with his owne. The workes that are our owne, are ſufficient to deſerue his wrath: but haue no power at all to procure his fauour. For in our ſelues we are wretched and miſerable, poore, naked, and deſtitute of all goodneſſe, ſo that it is truely ſaide by the Apoſtle <hi>Paule,</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 4, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Who ſeparateth thee? And what hast thou, that thou haſt not receiued? If thou hast receiued it, why reioyſest thou, as though thou hadst not receiued it.</hi> Without him therefore we can do nothing: it is he that muſt work in vs the will and the deede.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they muſt be ſuch workes as are not due vnto him, they muſt not be due debt, they muſt come from our owne free will, they muſt be ſuch as God cannot iuſtly challenge at our hands. But whatſoeuer we do, we do as poore debters; nay, we are worſe then poore debters, wee are miſerable Bankrupts, we haue nothing, we haue leſſe then nothing to pay. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour hath a worthy ſentence to this purpoſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 17, 10. <hi>When ye haue done all thoſe things that are commanded you, ſay, we are vnprofitable ſeruants, we haue done that which was our duty to do.</hi> And what could <hi>Adam</hi> do, and offer vnto
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:7222:243"/> God in his innocency, but that which was his duty; and whereunto he was bound vnto his Maker, for his Creation and other bleſſings beſtowed vpon him?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the worke muſt be done to the benefit and profit of him, from whom we looke to be repayed. <hi>But our goodneſſe and well-doing reacheth not to the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 16. We may benefit men, but wee cannot benefit our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, from whom we haue receiued life and limbe, ſoule and body, &amp; all that we haue, but we can giue him nothing. Now they that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not giue anie thing to God, can deſerue nothing from him: but wee cannot giue any thing to God, according to the ſaying of <hi>Paule,</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 11, 35. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>Who hath giuen vnto him firſt, and he ſhall be recompenſed? For of him, and through him, and for him are all things, to him be glory for euer, Amen:</hi> therefore, it is euident that wee cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, whatſoeuer is vnperfect, cannot ſtand in the preſence of the moſt iuſt and perfect God: we muſt bring nothing before him, but that which is abſolute, and able to beare and ſuſtaine his wrath. But all that we doe offer, or can offer vnto God, is maimed and vnperfect: ſuch are our beſt Workes, our Prayers, our Meditations, our Hearing, ſo that our righteouſneſſe is like a <note n="f" place="margin">Eſay 64, 6.</note> menſtruous cloath. Whatſoeuer proceedeth from vs, is foule and faulty, no man is able to ſatisfie the Iuſtice and rigor of the Law, according to that of the Apoſtle, <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 3, 10, 12, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>There is none righteous, no not one; they haue all gone out of the way, they haue beene made altogether vnprofitable, there is none that doth good. no, not one; and therefore by the workes of the Law ſhall no fleſh be iustified in his ſight.</hi> Wee muſt all entreate for pardon and forgiueneſſe of our euill Workes, and not ſtand vppon the perfection and ſufficiencie of our good workes.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the worke and the reward muſt be in proportion equall, for if the reward be more then the worke, it is not a rewarde of deſert, but a guift of good will. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, <hi>I account that the afflictions of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, are not worthy of the glory, which ſhall be ſhewed vnto vs.</hi> Thus then we reaſon; Nothing can deſerue, but that which is equiualent to the thing deſerued: but nothing that we can do, can equall or deſerue the guiftes, the leaſt guift of God. So then, albeit we had ſome-what to giue, and that wee were not as moſt naked and needy beggers; yet it cannot be compared or correſpondent to that which we receiue. For grace and glory are vnvalew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and vnmatchable, no price can purchaſe them, no mony can buy them, no merits can match them. So then, whether we conſider that GOD will haue the glory of all his workes, or that there is a great diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Mercy and Merits; in both reſpects we conclude, that the guiftes of GOD giuen vnto his faithfull ſeruants, proceede from his free grace, not from our free will, ſo that they are not deſerued of vs, but beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.</note> This Doctrine being thoroughly ſtrengthned, let vs ſee what Vſes may be grounded from thence. Firſt, we learne from hence, that ſeeing God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not by deſert, but of his mercy; that whatſoeuer we haue obtained and receiued by any prayer, or other meanes from the hand of God, wee muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe all to the glory and praiſe of his name, and acknowledge him to bee the Author and giuer. True it is, we are commanded to call vpon the Lord, and to put vp our ſuits and ſupplications vnto him: and when we haue prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and God hath heard our prayer, we muſt not thinke that wee haue well deſerued to ſpeed in our deſires, and ſay; <hi>For my righteouſneſſe, &amp; the ſtrength of my Prayers, I haue gotten this or that:</hi> but as we vſe the meanes, ſo we muſt acknowledge that God findeth ſuch faults in our beſt prayers, that he might curſe vs, rather then bleſſe vs; and condemne vs rather then heare vs; and withall conſider, that in hearing vs, he reſpecteth more that which is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:7222:244"/> then any thing that is in vs, he is moued rather of his owne mercy, then any abſoluteneſſe that he can ſee in our well-doing. Let vs therefore me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate vpon our owne wants, and albeit we vſe thoſe helpes and Inſtruments that he hath appointed, yet let vs giue him all the glory to whom it is wholly due. When a great multitude of enemies came againſt <hi>Iehoſhaphat,</hi> he ſet himſelfe to ſeeke the Lord, and proclaimed a faſt through out all <hi>Iudah, They asked counſell of the Lord, and prayed vnto him:</hi> yet when God had giuen them the vpper hand; they bleſſed not themſelues, but the Lord; they prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not their owne zeale, but his mercy; and they aſcribed not the victorie to their faſting and prayer, but to his fauour and power: <note n="h" place="margin">2 Chron. 20 26, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>For they aſſembled themſelues in the Valley of Berachah, and there they bleſſed the Lord: then euery Man of Iudah and Hieruſalem returned with Iehoſhaphat their head, to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to Ieruſalem with ioy, for the Lord had made them to reioyce ouer their Enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like we might ſay of <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> The example of the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> is plentifull in this Argument, he oftentimes prayſeth the Lord, becauſe hee had heard the voyce of his petition, as Pſal. 65. <hi>O God,</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 65, 1, 2. and 98. 1. and 115, 1.</note> 
                  <hi>praiſe waiteth for thee in Sion, and vnto thee ſhall the vow be performed, becauſe thou heareſt the Prayer, vnto thee ſhall all fleſh come.</hi> And Pſal. 98. <hi>Sing vnto the Lord a new ſong, for he hath done maruellous thinges: his right hand and his holy arme hath gotten him the victory.</hi> And Pſal. 115. <hi>Not vs, ô Lord, not vnto vs, but vnto thy Name giue the glory, for thy louing mercy, and for thy truths ſake.</hi> And heereby we may diſcouer a deepe deuiſe, a dangerous plot, and a deceitfull pollicy of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. He laboureth by all meanes to keepe vs from Prayer, he cannot abide that we ſhould call vpon the name of our God. He will tell vs of <note n="k" place="margin" type="runSum">How Sathan worketh to hinder vs from praying.</note> the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Maieſty of God to diſmay vs; hee will ſuggeſt our owne baſeneſſe and vnworthineſſe to diſcourage vs; he will obiect that others pray not at all, yet do well enough, &amp; that they liue in all abundance, and want nothing, yet are not ſo deuout; he will tell vs (to make vs ſecure) that God knoweth whereof we haue neede before we aske, that he needeth not to be put in minde of his mercy, and that he cannot forget the couenant that hee hath made with vs. Theſe are ſubtile baites to intrap vs, and mighty ſtumbling blockes to trip vs, and ſtrong tentations to ſlay vs, and by theſe he oftentimes preuaileth in the Children of diſobedience. If he cannot obtaine his purpoſe of vs at the firſt, yet he will not giue ouer, but follow vs hard at the heeles, till hee hath ſubdued vs; and marke our foote-ſteppes, till he hath enſnared vs. He will ſay vnto thee, when thou prepareſt thy ſelfe to pray, what needeſt thou pray at this time? Thou art now vnfit; thou art without feeling; thou haſt other buſineſſe to goe about, another time will ſerue as well, or better then this, when thou mayeſt be better fitted to this worke. For if thou pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feeling and zeale, thou ſinneſt, and thy prayer is abhominable; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take heed thou pray not, leaſt thou ſinne againſt God.</p>
               <p>Thus he preuailed with <hi>Saule,</hi> when the Prieſt brought the Arke of God to aske counſell of him what he ſhould doe, <note n="l" place="margin">1 Sam. 14, 19</note> 
                  <hi>Saule</hi> ſaid vnto him, <hi>Withdraw thine hand:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay; Let vs purſue our enemies, I haue no leyſure to ſtand asking counſell of God. If he preuaile with vs, to neglect this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at one time, he will take aduantage of it, ſo that if he ſee vs ready to pray afterward, he will alledge, what needeſt thou pray yet? Thou omittedſt it at ſuch and ſuch a time, and thou ſpeddeſt well enough, thou hadſt no euill or hurt by it, why then wilt thou now beginne? It will but trouble thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to be alwaies praying, it will hinder thy buſineſſe, and cauſe thee to neglect thy calling: yea, when thou haſt done all thou canſt, thou ſhalt get nothing by it, but ſhalt make thy ſelfe a laughing-ſtocke, and a gazing-ſtocke to the whole World; wherefore it were much better for thee to doe as many other of thy good and honeſt Neighbours, that are not ſo curious
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:7222:244"/> and preciſe in theſe matters, who are beloued in the World, and looke to come to heauen as well as thy ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, he will not forget to tell thee, that if thou betake thy ſelfe to this ſtrict courſe of life, it will bring thee into many melancholy dumps, and ſo caſt thee downe, that thou ſhalt neuer be merry at the heart. This is the Deuils Logicke and Language, or rather his ſophiſtry and ſubtilty, and thus he doth diſcourſe and diſpute with vs, to draw vs away from this duty. For well doth he know, that prayer is a principall part of our ſpirituall Armour, whereby we are ſafe garded from him, and all other enemies, and the moſt effectuall meanes to kindle in vs the ſauing and ſanctified Graces of Gods Spirit: and therefore when wee ceaſe praying, God will ſtay his hand from bleſſing vs; he will with-holde his graces from vs; he will giue vs ouer into the power of our ſpirituall enemies, and renounce vs from being in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Children. <note place="margin" type="runSum">How Sathan poyſoneth our prayers, to make them voyde.</note> But if he cannot thus farre preuaile with vs, but that the conſcience of Gods commaundement and our owne dutie, will ſtirre vs vp to this practiſe: then he worketh in vs another way, and creepeth vpon vs after another manner. Hee will after a ſort cloſe with vs, and ioyne in the acknowledgment of the neceſſity of daily exerciſing our ſelues in making Prayer vnto God: but withall, he will foyſt in a falſe finger, and tell vs, that by deuout Prayer we ſhall merit ſaluation, and that the moe our Prayers are, the greater ſhall be our merits.</p>
               <p>Thus he mingleth and tempereth rancke Poyſon with Prayer, ſo that albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it we vſe it, we doe abuſe it; ſo that it is all one as if we vſed it not. Thus he ſheweth himſelfe to be ready at our Elbow, to puffe vs vp with pride, and to tell vs that we pray oftner then others, better then others, with greater fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling then others, with greater faith then others, with greater zeale and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance then others. Thus he preuailed with the Phariſe, mentioned in the Goſpell, <note n="n" place="margin">Luke 18, 11 12.</note> he ſtood and prayed thus with himſelfe; <hi>O God, I thanke thee, that I am not as other men, Extortioners, vniuſt, Adulterers, or euen as this Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can: I faſt twice in the weeke, I giue Tithe of all that euer I poſſeſſe:</hi>

                  <hi>I loue to pray in the Synagogues, and in the Corners of the ſtreetes:</hi> 
                  <note n="p" place="margin">Math. 23, 14</note> 
                  <hi>but vnder a colour of long Praiers they ſought the praiſe of men, and the enriching of themſelues, and therefore were to receiue the greater damnation.</hi> And as in the former times of the Church, when he could not keepe them any longer in Fornication and vncleanneſſe (as if it were a thing indifferent) he taught chaſtity, thereby to deſtroy chaſtity; and vnder a falſe praiſe of ſingle life brought in the deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of marriage, and the practiſe of incontinency: ſo doth hee perſwade Prayer, thereby to ouerthrow Prayer. For to mooue to pray, thereby to merrit and deſerue, is to corrupt Prayer, and to make it of none effect. It is the duty of the Miniſter of God to preach the word, it hath the promiſe of bleſſing, and of great reward: but if he goe about to perſwade vs, that wee ſhall merit eternall life by our faithfulneſſe in our Miniſtry, and by diligent inſtructing of the people committing to our charge, <note n="q" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib. de obitu Knoxi.</hi>
                  </note> we muſt reſiſt the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till Serpent, and defie him, and deny his merrits. It is the duty of all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that haue this Worlds goods, to giue almes to the poore, eſpecially to the godly poore: but if he mooue vs to giue Almes, that we may get Heauen or gaine the praiſe of men, we muſt ſtriue againſt his tentation, and not ſuffer our ſelues to be deluded by him. For this is as much as if he ſhould ſay vnto vs, I would haue thee pray, but thou ſhalt obtaine nothing: I would haue thee giue almes, but thou ſhalt haue no reward. Seeing then, we are ſubiect to a double tentation of Sathan (who goeth about like a roaring Lion ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king whom he may deuour) ſo that he will (if it be poſsible) hinder vs from Prayers, or (if he cannot) will corrupt them with his Leauen of merrit: we muſt prepare to reſiſt him <note n="r" place="margin" type="runSum">The meanes how to reſiſt Satan in his tentations.</note> both waies. Whenſoeuer he goeth about to ſtay vs from praying vnto our heauenly Father, we muſt reſiſt him ſtrong in faith,
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:7222:245"/> and oppoſe againſt him theſe Meditations. Let vs remember Gods moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commaundement, to call vpon him in the day <note n="ſ" place="margin">Pſal. 50, 15.</note> of trouble, and that wee are continually to watch and pray, <note n="t" place="margin">Luke 22, 40, 46.</note> leaſt we fall into tentation. We haue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the precept, a promiſe annexed for our comfort and greater en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to this duty, that he is neere to all that call vpon him; euen to all that call vpon him in truth; yea, the eies of the Lord are vpon the iuſt, and his eares are open vnto their prayers.</p>
               <p>Let vs conſider, that there is an abſolute neceſſity of the inuocation of his Name, and of crauing his aſſiſtance, that we may be freed and deliuered from the ſnares and aſſaults of the Deuill, and that hee would giue vs ſtrength to ouercome them, and not ſuffer vs to be tempted aboue our power, but giue a bleſſed iſſue of the tentation, that we may be made able to beare it. And as the neceſſitie is great to call vpon him daily, <hi>In whom we line and mooue, and haue our beeing;</hi> ſo the profit thereof is no leſſe; it bringeth a bleſſed experience and tryall of Gods goodneſſe and mercy toward vs: It encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his ſpirituall graces in vs, and maketh vs zealous in all good workes: It obtaineth thoſe thinges that we want, and remooueth the iudgements that hang ouer vs, or are vpon vs. We haue the examples of all the faithfull, as a Cloud of Witneſſes to incite vs to this duty. And if we put foorth our hands to take and vſe any of the Creatures or bleſſings of God without aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him leaue, we are no better then Theeues and Robbers. Theſe and ſuch like Motiues, ſerue to kindle our zeale in Prayer, &amp; to quench the fiery darts of the Deuill which he caſteth at vs. If he go about to puffe vs vp with pride, through an opinion merriting by any, euen our beſt workes of Prayer, or Preaching, or Almes-deedes, wee muſt know that all our workes are vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and that the good thinges in vs are his owne guifts.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that the Apoſtle ſaith of himſelfe and all his labours; <note n="u" place="margin">1 Cor. 15, 9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>I am the least of the Apostles: by the Grace of God I am that I am, and his Grace which is in me, was not in vaine.

                  <hi>Neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth, but God that giueth the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</hi> Againe, <note n="y" place="margin">1 Cor. 4, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>What haſt thou that thou hast not receiued? If thou hast re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it, why boaſteſt thou as though thou hadſt not receiued it?</hi> It is a worthy ſaying ſet downe by our Sauiour, <note n="z" place="margin">Luke 17, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>When ye haue done all thoſe things which are commaunded you, ſay; We are vnprofitable Seruants, wee haue done that which was our duty to doe.</hi> Wherefore, we muſt labour in all our workes to ſee our imperfections, to caſt downe ourſelues in humility before the Iudgement ſeat of God, and to referre all things to his glory.

                  <hi>Whether ye eate, or drinke, or whatſoeuer ye doe, doe all to the glorie of God.</hi> And if in theſe ordinary and naturall workes, we muſt ayme at that end as at a marke: how much more, in the Myſteries of our ſaluation, and the great keyes of our Religion, ought wee to giue thankes vnto God for bleſsing vs with ſpirituall bleſsings in heauenly thinges? We are not able to inſpire Grace into our barren hearts, it is the guift of God, and therefore he muſt be confeſſed the giuer of euery good giuing and perfect guift, to the glory of his owne Name. And for our ſelues, let vs in all duties of our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; Prayer, Almes, or whatſoeuer workes approoued of God, prepare our ſelues to bring humble and broken hearts, freed from the Thornes of pride and vaine-glory.</p>
               <p>This is taught by <hi>Dauid</hi> in the Pſalme, <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 51, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>The Sacrifices of God are a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite Spirit: a contrite and a broken heart, ô God, thou wilt not despiſe.</hi> The like we ſee, Eſay 66. <note n="c" place="margin">Eſay 66, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>To him will I looke, ſaith the Lord, euen to him that is poore and of a contrite ſpirit, and trembleth at my wordes.</hi> And thus was the practiſe of <hi>Daniell</hi> in his Prayer, <note n="d" place="margin">Dan. 9, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>O Lorde, encline thine eare, open thine eyes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our deſolations: for we doe not preſent our ſupplications before thee for our
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:7222:245" rendition="simple:additions"/> owne righteouſneſſe, but for thy great tender mercies.</hi> This humility ſhall appeare to be in vs, if we referre the end of all our actions to the honour of God, and make that to be the ſcope. Let the principall end be the glory of God: the next, the ſaluation of our Soules: the third, the edification of our Brethren in Chriſt Ieſus. Let vs cauſe our light ſo to ſhine before men, that they may glorifie our Father which is in Heauen: and then let vs follow thoſe thinges which concerne peace, and where-with one may edifie another.</p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 2.</note> Secondly, as by the free beſtowing of the graces of God, we are taught to giue him all poſsible praiſe, ſo it taketh away all opinion of the merits of workes, wherein proud fleſh is ready to truſt. For to place Merit and Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in our owne workes, is to raſe down a cheefe Foundation and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Piller of Chriſtian Religion; both becauſe thereby we aboliſh Grace, and renounce ſaluation by Chriſt, and make euery man a Sauiour to himſelfe, and ſo exclude ſaluation by Chriſt: all which are ſhamefull Hereſies and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blaſphemies, and deteſtable abhominations. As many as ſeeke to be iuſtified by the Law, are fallen from Grace. Therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, Rom. 11. <hi>There is a remnant according to the election of Grace,</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 11, 5, 6</note> 
                  <hi>and if it be of Grace, it is no more of workes, or elſe were Grace no more Grace: but if it be of workes, it is no more Grace, or elſe were worke no more worke.</hi> This ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to confute the Romiſh Doctrin, &amp; giueth vs iuſt cauſe to come out from among them, and to make a ſeparation from them, as being no true Church of God. For in aſmuch as they take away the foundation and cheefe pillers whereupon the houſe of God ſtandeth, they pull it downe and bring it to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. We ſee how they exclude Grace, and bring in Merrit. They eſtabliſh a two-fold kind of Merit, and both of them (as they vnderſtand them) plants of their owne ſetting, but meere Strangers in the Garden of the Scriptures, and therefore ſhall fall; according to the Doctrine of Chriſt, who ſaith; <note n="f" place="margin">Math. 15, 13</note> 
                  <hi>Euery Plant which mine heauenly Father hath not planted, ſhall be rooted vp.</hi> One ſort is the <note n="g" place="margin" type="runSum">A two-folde merrit taught in the Church of Rome.</note> merrit of the perſon; the other, is the merrit of the worke. The merrit of the perſon, they make to be a dignity in the perſon, wheredy hee is eſteemed worthy of eternall life; and this they ſay is found in Infants dying after Baptiſme, who, though they want the merit of good workes, yet they want not the merrit of their perſons, by which they receiue the Kingdome of heauen. The merrit of the worke, is a Dignity or excellency in the worke in it ſelfe, whereby it is fitted and inabled to deſerue life euerlaſting. Hence it is that they teach, that the worke and the deed are meritorious two waies; firſt, by Couenant, becauſe God hath made a promiſe of reward vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Secondly, by their owne Dignity, becauſe Chriſt hath merited, that our workes ſhould merrit. A ſtrange opinion, and a ſtrange language and manner of ſpeaking, neuer heard of in the Booke of God. As for vs, wee renounce all perſonall merrits; that is, all merrits within the perſon of any meere man: alſo all merrits of workes done by any meere man whatſoeuer. The true merrit whereby we looke for the fauour of God and life euerlaſting, is to be found in the perſon and workes of Chriſt alone, who is the treaſurie and ſtore-houſe of all our merrits.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note> But heere ſome man might obiect and ſay; The promiſe of reward is made to them that beleeue and worke, therefore our workes doe merrit: for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and reward be Relatiues. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> I anſwere, there is a double reward; one of Merrit, the other of Mercy. Euery good worke, be it neuer ſo little, done in Faith, done to the glory of God, done in that manner that he commaundeth, ſhall bee rewarded, but the reward is not giuen for the worthineſſe of the worke, but through the liberality of him that hath promiſed. Hence it is, that eternall life is called an Inheritance. The obedient Childe hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe from his Father to be his Heire, and to inherit his Lands, Goods, and Poſſeſsions, after his deceaſe; yet not for his obedience ſake, but becauſe his
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:7222:246"/> Father loueth him, and in kindneſſe and compaſsion preferreth him before others. Let it ſuffice vs, to haue the Kingdome of Heauen as a free inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and not dreame as Hirelings, that we ſhall haue it as an hire and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of our worke, for then we ſhall be deceiued of our hope and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is a vaine confidence to ſet vp ſuch an high price of our workes, as thereby to make them able to buy Heauen. Theſe men do know, neither the weakeneſſe of their owne ſtrength, nor the vnworthineſſe of their owne workes, nor the wretchedneſſe of their owne perſons, nor the excellency of Gods Graces, nor the praiſe of his glory, whereof he is iealous, which hee will not giue to any other. They are like to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> 
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Actes 8, 18.</note> who offered to buy the guifts of God for his Money, as a purchaſe: or like to the <note n="i" place="margin">Math. 6, 7.</note> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, that looke to be heard for their much babling ſake: or like to Seruants that doe all for their hire. So theſe Merit-mongers will haue no Heauen, except they may haue it as their hire, and as a penny-worth for their penny; they will not be indebted vnto God, nor beholding vnto him for it. As for vs, we value not our good workes at ſo high a rate, we know their imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we craue eternall life as a Sons portion, and an inheritance freely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed vnto vs, and freely beſtowed vpon vs.</p>
               <p>Indeede, it is the will and pleaſure of God, that wee ſhould labour and bring forth good workes, to expreſſe our thankfulneſſe to him that hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted vs for his Children; and after our labour, receiue the inheritance: yet we cannot deſerue it by our obedience, and we haue a better claime vnto it, by being Sonnes, then working as Seruants. We confeſſe, that the reward ſhall be giuen of bounty, not of neceſsity; by guift, not by debt; by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, not by deſert; by Gods acceptation, not through our perfection. As for the Papiſts, that glory in their owne workes, let them take heede they do not deceiue themſelues, and whilſt they rob God of his honour, let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware they doe not robbe themſelues, and depriue themſelues of the honour promiſed to the Saintes: and whilſt they challenge and lay claime to euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life, as to the Wages of Seruants, let them in time looke to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, leaſt they be denyed the Inheritance that belongeth vnto Sonnes.</p>

The Children of God, whenſoeuer they preſented themſelues into his preſence; they haue ſtripped themſelues of all thinges; they haue renounced all priuiledges of the fleſh; they haue acknowledged their owne vnworthineſſe, and haue craued nothing but his fauour, and to bee ſatisfied with his Image.

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The order of the words.</note> Hitherto, we haue handled the cheefe matter touching this Epiſtle, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his ſute for <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> and his commandement to prepare him lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. Now followeth the Concluſion and ſhutting vp of the Epiſtle, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in certaine ſalutations, which are of two ſorts; either from others, or from himſelfe. The ſalutation from others is in theſe two Verſes: the ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from himſelfe is in the Verſe following. In theſe Verſes he ſaluteth <hi>Philemon</hi> in the name of fiue perſons which were famous and well known in the Church, and of great authority and credit aboue many others. This ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation as it was very honourable vnto him, ſo alſo it carried with it great waight and moment to effect his principall purpoſe with more eaſineſſe. For ſeeing hee ioyneth with him <hi>His Fellow-priſoner,</hi> and <hi>Fellow-helpers</hi> in this ſute, that he might the better obtaine his requeſt, ſo that they all put vp as it were with one voice and conſent the ſame petition, <hi>Philemon</hi> could not but conſider, that it was a verie vnſeemely and vnworthy thing to reiect ſo many ſuppliants in ſo reaſonable a cauſe. So then, the ſum of theſe wordes is this, <hi>Epaphras, Marcus, Ariſtarchus, Demas,</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> do ſalute thee. The firſt man is deſcribed by an adioyned propertie, my <hi>Fellow-Priſoner;</hi> which is declared by the cauſe, <hi>For Ieſus Christ.</hi> The reſt that are heere na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, haue one common adioynt as a title of honor aſcribed vnto them when he calleth them <hi>his Fellow-helpers.</hi>

Now, let vs ſee the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Interpretation of the wordes.

Thus did the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:7222:247"/> pray one for another. In this ſalutation he nameth fiue perſons. In the firſt place, he rangeth <hi>Epaphras,</hi> a Cittizen of the ſame Citty with <hi>Philemon</hi> and his Countreyman, as appeareth in the Epiſtle to the Coloſſians, chap. 4. <hi>Epaphras</hi>

                  <hi>As ye alſo learned of Epaphras our deere fellow ſeruant, which is for you a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Minister of Christ.</hi> It ſeemeth he was an Euangeliſt, who ſucceeded in the labours of the Apoſtles, but now being at Rome, hee was put in priſon, and heere ſaluteth <hi>Philemon</hi> as a Fellow-priſoner of <hi>Paule,</hi> not for anie wickedneſſe and crime that he had committed, but for the Teſtimonie of Chriſt, and for preaching the Goſpell, and therefore is called not <hi>Caeſars</hi> priſoner, but <hi>Christs Priſoner.</hi> Whereby it appeareth, that this <hi>Epaphras</hi> was falſely accuſed by the enemies of the Goſpell, and therefore brought vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> and put in hold.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he nameth <hi>Marcus,</hi> who is mentioned alſo in other places of the Scripture, who was Cozen to <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and the ſonne of that <hi>Marie,</hi> who was wont to giue entertainement to the Diſciples at Ieruſalem; yea, ſuch was her godlineſſe, that ſhee made her houſe as an Inne to lodge the poore Saints, and as a publicke Temple for the people of God to meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to pray vnto him, and to praiſe his name. This appeareth, <hi>Col.</hi> 4, 10. <hi>Marcus ſaluteth thee Barnabas Couſin, touching whom ye receiued Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, if hee come vnto you, receiue him.</hi> So<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when <hi>Peter</hi> was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of priſon, it is ſaide, <note n="q" place="margin">Acts. 12, 12.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, he ſaluteth <hi>Philemon</hi> in the name of <hi>Aristarchus,</hi> of whome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo mention is made in the Epiſtle to the Coloſſians, and there likewiſe he is called <hi>Paules priſoner,</hi>

                  <hi>Aristarchus my Priſon-fellow ſaluteth you.</hi> As they embraced one Faith, and beleeued in one Chriſt, ſo they ſuffered for one cauſe, and were Companions in affliction?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he nameth <hi>Demas,</hi> who at this time was a conſtant Confeſſer of the truth, and a zealous follower of the Goſpell, but afterward hee ſtarted backe from the Doctrine of Chriſt, forſooke the fellowſhip of <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced this preſent world, as the Apoſtle complaineth of him afterward, as we ſee, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4, 10. <hi>Demas hath forſaken mee, and hath embraced this preſent world, and is departed vnto Theſſalonica.</hi>

               <p>We heard in the beginning of this Epiſtle, that <hi>Paule</hi> ioyned <hi>Timothy</hi> to him, as a ioynt Writer thereof, and directeth it to others, beſides to <hi>Philemon,</hi> that they might bee meanes and Mediatours vnto him; ſo in the winding vp of the Epiſtle, hee hath muſtered together many others: by all which, he ſetteth vppon <hi>Philemon,</hi> as it were, with an Army of Interceſſers and Aduocates, to ſoften and ouercome his greeued and offended minde, and to encline him to mercie and compaſſion.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The time when this Epiſtle written.</note> Moreouer, this ſalutation giueth vs ſome direction of the time when this Epiſtle was written.

<pb n="467" facs="tcp:7222:247"/> after the ſecond that hee wrote to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and this reaſon is rendered, becauſe in that Epiſtle it appeareth, that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> were not with him, and hee willeth them to make ſpeede to come vnto him, <note n="z" place="margin">2 Tim. 4, 9, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Onely Luke is with mee: Take Marke and bring him with thee, for hee is profitable vnto me to Minister.</hi> But in this Epiſtle it is euident, that theſe men were come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.

But if we diligently marke it, and throughly conſider of it, we ſhall finde it to be too weake to beare the waight of this concluſion. For this preſent Epiſtle, as alſo that to the Coloſſians was written when hee was firſt taken; the ſecond to <hi>Timothy,</hi> when he was taken the ſecond time. For <hi>Paul</hi> hauing appealed to <hi>Caeſar</hi> from the partial dealing of the High-Prieſts, and the cruell perſecution of his owne nation, was brought to Rome in the beginning of <hi>Neroes</hi> raigne, about the thirde or fourth yeare thereof. Now it is euident and knowne to all, that <hi>Nero</hi> in the fiue firſt yeares, was one of the moſt milde and mercifull Princes; and as in his laſt yeares, hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded all men in Tyranny and Crueltie, ſo in his firſt, <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sueto. in Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</hi>
                  </note> hee paſſed all his predeceſſors in Mercie and Gentleneſſe. In the beginning of his Empyre, <hi>Paule</hi> pleaded his cauſe before him, and was deliuered out of priſon, and let go whether he would. But the rage of the enemies of the Goſpell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing endleſſe, hee was taken againe about the end of <hi>Neroes</hi> raigne, who waxed madde againſt Chriſtian Religion, at which time hee wrote the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> wherein he fore-telleth the approaching of his death, and the time of his diſſolution, <note n="c" place="margin">2 Tim. 4, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departing is at hand.</hi> Thus much touching the time when this Epiſtle was written.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Generall Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruations pointed out in theſe verſes.</note> Now, let vs point out ſome generall Obſeruations out of theſe Verſes that might be enlarged, and farther ſtood vpon, if time would ſerue. Firſt, we ſee the Apoſtle ſetteth down a ſalutation proceeding from others: which teacheth that ſalutations are an ordinary meanes ordained of God to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and cherriſh mutuall loue, and that vnion and coniunction which the members of Chriſts body haue one with another, who are onely in body, &amp; in regard of bodily preſence ſeuered one from another in this preſent life; whereas in heart they are ioyned together, and ſhall bee heereafter both in ſoule and body.</p>
               <p>Secondly, albeit the Apoſtle were a priſoner for the faithes ſake, yet God doth not leaue him alone, hee hath <hi>A Fellow-priſoner</hi> ioyned with him, and many Fellow-helpers added vnto him. And albeit hee delighteth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the impriſonment of another, but could rather wiſh him deliuered, as appeareth by his words to <hi>Agrippa</hi> (who ſaide he was almoſt perſwaded to become a Chriſtian,) <note n="d" place="margin">Acts 26, 28, 29.</note> 
                  <hi>I woulde to God, that not onely thou, but alſo all that heare mee to day, were both almost and altogether ſuch as I am, except theſe bondes: yet notwithstanding the Company of the Godly is gracious and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both in prosperitie, and in aduerſity, both in priſon, and out of priſon.</hi> Thus it is ſet downe by Luke, <hi>Acts</hi> 16, 25. when <hi>Paul</hi> was whipped and impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and his feet made faſt in the ſtockes, he had <hi>Silas</hi> ioyned with him, and they two ſpent the night in praying and praiſing God togither, teaching &amp; admoniſhing themſelues in Pſalmes and Hymnes, and ſpirituall ſongs, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a grace in their hearts to the Lord, ſo that the priſoners hearde them. Thus we ſee the endleſſe Mercie of God, towards his afflicted and diſtreſſed Seruants, hee rayſeth them vp ſome comfort, and ſome Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, verifying the promiſe made to his Church, <hi>If I depart, I will ſend the Comforter vnto you.</hi> Hee knoweth our infirmities, hee ſeeth how readie
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:7222:248"/> we are to yeeld and ſlide back: &amp; therefore as he ſtrengthneth vs by others, ſo he maketh vs meanes to ſtrengthen others.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hee calleth <hi>Epaphras</hi> a priſoner of Chriſt, as hee alſo had called himſelfe before in the beginning of this Epiſtle. The reaſon is, becauſe he had preached Chriſt. Heereby we learne, that perſecutions oftentimes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſincere preaching of the Goſpell; not that it is the propertie of the Goſpell, but the cauſe is the malice of ſuch as will not embrace and receiue the Goſpell; and therefore, they hate and perſecute thoſe that beleeue in Chriſt, and giue entertainment to the Goſpell. This is it our Sauiour tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10, 34, 35. <hi>Thinke not that I am come to ſend peace into the earth, I came not to ſend peace, but the ſworde: for I am come to ſet a Man at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance against his Father, and the Daughter against the Mother, &amp;c. and a mans enemies ſhall be they of his owne houſhold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this purpoſe he ſpeaketh in another place, <note n="g" place="margin">Luke 12, 49.</note> 
                  <hi>I am come to put fire on the earth, and what is my deſire, if it be already kindled?</hi> The Goſpell is the proper cauſe of peace among the godly, ſo it is the occaſion of great troble among the wicked. They are therefore much deceiued, that make the Goſpell the cauſe of all diuiſion and hurly-burlies that are in the Worlde. When any troubles ariſe, the preaching of the Goſpell is accuſed to breede them, but this is a falſe imputation. The true cauſe, is the mallice of Sathan, and the furie of his Inſtruments, that cannot abide the Light of the Truth to ſhine among them. So then, let vs not thinke it a ſtraunge thing, when we ſee ſuch ſtirres and tumults ariſe, but Arme our ſelues with Patience; Learne to bee VViſe as Serpents, and Innocent as Doues, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thoſe that are the authors and beginners of thoſe broyles and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, obſerue the Titles that hee giueth vnto our Lorde and Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, he deſcribeth him by two Names; Firſt, hee calleth him Chriſt; then, hee calleth him Ieſus. Chriſt, ſignifyeth as much as Annointed; Ieſus, importeth as much as a Sauiour, who was ſo called, <note n="h" place="margin">Math. 1, 21.</note> becauſe hee ſaueth his people from their ſinnes. From whence, obſerue that Chriſt is the King, the Prophet, and the Prieſt of his Church, to gouerne vs, to teach vs, to Redeeme vs, to ſaue vs. This is his Office, for theſe Ends and Vſes hee was annointed of the Father with the Oyle of Gladneſſe aboue his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. This ſerueth to our great good, and the benefit of it is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs; he maketh vs <note n="i" place="margin">Reuel. 1, 6.</note> Kings and Prieſts to God his Father; he armeth vs with power and ſtrength againſt ſinne, the Fleſh, the World, the Deuill; and maketh vs able to ouercome them: thorough him wee haue acceſſe to the father, and may boldly appeare in his ſight, and offer vp our Prayers with aſſurance, <note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 12, 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Yea he enableth vs to offer vppe our ſelues, our ſoules, and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, an holy, liuely, and acceptable Sacrifice vnto him,</hi> which is our reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſeruing of him: hee doth enſtruct vs in the will of his Father, enlighten vs in the knowledge of the trueth, and maketh vs (as it were) his Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Diſciples and Schollers, to reueale vnto vs all thinges needefull for our ſaluation. Let vs therefore confeſſe him to be the onely ſonne of God, perfect God, and perfect Man, <note n="l" place="margin">1 Tim. 2, 5.</note> the ſole Mediator betweene God and Man, and let vs acknowledge no other Sauiour able to Redeeme and ranſome vs, to pay ſo great a price, and to deliuer vs from ſo great wrath and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If wee make other Mediatours, and ſet vp other Sauiours, wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Mediation of Chriſt, and Saluation purchaſed by Chriſt. This pierceth the verie Marrow, and entereth into the bowelles of the Romiſh Religion, which ſetteth vp other Mediators, and conſequently eſtabliſheth a falſe Chriſt of their owne, which indeed is no Chriſt, no Ieſus, no Sauiour, no Redeemer?</p>
               <p>Fiftly, obſerue with me, that ſpeaking of <hi>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas,</hi> &amp;
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:7222:248"/> 
                  <hi>Luke,</hi> he calleth them his fellow-helpers; whereby he putteth the Miniſters of the Goſpell, and all the Children of God in minde, to bee helpers to the truth, and to further the preaching and propagation of the Goſpell by all poſſible meanes that God hath enabled them. For this cauſe, the Apoſtle commendeth many of the faithfull, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16, 3, 9. <hi>Greet Aquila and Priſcilla my fellow-helpers in Christ Ieſus.</hi> We muſt doe all for the truth, and nothing againſt the truth.</p>
               <p>This reproueth thoſe that employ their wits, and beſtow their ſtrength, to hinder the truth, and the profeſſors thereof. Theſe haue no part nor fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip in the Miniſtration, nor in the ſound profeſſion of the Goſpell, but are profeſſed enemies to the faith of Chriſt. Moreouer, this ſhall Miniſter vnſpeakeable comfort vnto vs, to conſider that wee haue beene helpers to the truth, and furtherers of the Faith which is in Chriſt Ieſus, we ſhall leaue a good Name behinde vs, and receiue and incorruptible Crowne of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Glory.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, note with mee, that when <hi>Paule</hi> wrote this Epiſtle, hee was at <hi>Rome,</hi> and hee ioyneth with him ſundry others, which were the cheefe and principall, whoſe verie names might carry ſome credite and authority to perſwade <hi>Philemon</hi> in this matter which hee vndertooke; yet in all this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle wee haue no mention of <hi>Peter,</hi> who is ſuppoſed to haue liued there, to haue dyed there, to haue beene Byſhop there fiue and twenty yeares. He ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to himſelfe ſo many Aſſiſtants as he could, to obtaine his ſuite. He wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth (as we heard before, from <hi>Rome</hi>) to haue <hi>Oneſimus</hi> pardoned, and hee vſeth the name of <hi>Timothy</hi> to that purpoſe; why is <hi>Peter</hi> heere forgotten? Why doth he not ioyne him with himſelfe in the ſame Epiſtle, if he had been reſident at Rome, as a good Byſhop ought to haue beene? Againe, we ſee he ſpecifieth many by name, <hi>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas,</hi> and <hi>Luke:</hi> but we haue no mention of <hi>Peter.</hi> And it is ſaid, that <hi>Marke</hi> was the Diſciple of <hi>Peter,</hi> and by his Commandement wrote his Goſpell: was it fit to name the Diſciple, and to forget the Maiſter? to remember the members, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the Head? To expreſſe meaner perſons, and to omit the principall? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he calleth theſe men his fellow-helpers; <hi>Paul</hi> was as the Maſter-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and cheefe builder, they were his helpers and partners in the buſineſſe. Was not <hi>Peter</hi> alſo one of his bretheren, and either a fellow-priſoner, or a fellow-helper in the Goſpell? Wherefore then is hee concealed? Obſerue with mee from hence, and by Conference of many other Scriptures, <note n="n" place="margin" type="runSum">
                     <hi>Peters</hi> being at <hi>Rome</hi> is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine.</note> that <hi>Peters</hi> being at <hi>Rome,</hi> is an vncertaine opinion, and an vngrounded aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>It was by compoſition agreed vpon betweene <hi>Paule</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> 
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Gal. 2, 9.</note> that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſhould preach to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> how then could <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſit as byſhop at <hi>Rome?</hi> Or if he preached to the <hi>Iewes</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it to paſſe that the chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religion was ſtrange, &amp; in a maner vnknown vnto them when <hi>Paul</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi> as appeareth in the end of the Actes of the Apoſtles, where they ſay vnto him, <note n="p" place="margin">Acts 28. 22</note> 
                  <hi>We will heare of thee what thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest, for as concerning this Sect, we know that euery where it is ſpoken against.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, when <hi>Paule</hi> wrote to the <hi>Romaines,</hi> hee willeth them to ſalute manie particularly, and by name, both men and weomen: but he maketh no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all of <hi>Peter,</hi> which no doubt he would haue done, if hee had at that time alſo beene at <hi>Rome.</hi> Furthermore, the Apoſtle Wrote many of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles from the Citty of <hi>Rome</hi> (as we ſhewed in the beginning of this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) as for example; to the <hi>Galathians, Epheſians, Coloſſians, Phillippians,</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> this to <hi>Philemon,</hi> and that other Epiſtle vnto the Hebrewes, (if it were his) and from thence, hee ſendeth manie ſalutations, in the Name of manie, that remained at Rome: Among whome, <hi>Peter</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer mentioned, but his name and beeing there, is ouer-paſſed. Laſtly,
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:7222:249"/> the Apoſtle teſtifieth, that while he was called forth to giue an account of his Faith, <note n="p" place="margin">2 Tim. 4, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>All did forſake him, and none aſſiſted him:</hi> wherefore, either <hi>Peter</hi> was not then at <hi>Rome,</hi> or if he were, he did ſhamefully forſake him. Thus then we conclude from theſe and ſuch like Circumſtances, that it cannot be gathered out of the holy Scriptures, that <hi>Peter</hi> was euer at <hi>Rome.</hi> Whereby we learne, that the Popiſh Religion is a doubtfull and vncertaine religion; their Faith is vncertaine; their Hope is vncertaine, their Heauen is vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. For, the ſupremacie of the Pope, and ſubiection to him, is made a fundamentall point of Religion, and the beleeuing of it neceſſary to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> a Cardinall of <hi>Rome,</hi> 
                  <note n="q" place="margin">
                     <hi>De Eccleſia militante, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</note> defining the Church, maketh it to be a Company of men, profeſſing the faith, and partaking of the Sacraments, vnder the iuriſdiction of the Byſhop of Rome, ſo that ſuch as hold no Pope, are iudged and cenſured to build vpon a falſe foundation, and therefore to be no true Churches, no ſound Catholickes, no right Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>The cheefe Controuerſie betweene vs and the Papiſts, is, for the Popes Monarchy and Authoritie ouer the Vniuerſal Church, which is maintained by many of them, as a materiall point, and neceſſarie for euery one to holde that looketh to be ſaued. Which is an Opinion both abſurd, and ridiculous, and vnreaſonable. The Church Triumphant in Heauen, is not ſubiect to the Pope of Rome. The Church of the Old-Teſtament, was neuer ſubiect to the Pope of Rome. The Church of the New-Teſtament, which was when Chriſt liued vpon the earth, was not ſubiect to the Pope of Rome. The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, that was in the dayes of the Apoſtles, was not ſubiect to the Pope of Rome. For during all this time, there was no Pope of Rome at all, and yet there was (during al this time) a Church; or elſe they muſt ſay, that the Triumphant Church, the Iewiſh Church, and the Chriſtian Church, are no Churches at all.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the neceſſity of ſubiecting euery ſoule to this ſuppoſed ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, and pretended primacy, doeth blot out of the number of Churches; the Eaſt-Churches, and the South-Churches, and leaueth onely the Roman Church, to whom the Title leaſt of all belongeth, or at leaſt, as little, as to any of the reſt. Beſides, at the death of euerie Pope, and in euery vacancie of that Sea (which ſometimes hath beene no ſmall time) the Church ſhould faile and fall: for how ſhould the faithfull then bee ſubiect to the Byſhop of Rome, when there is no Byſhoppe of Rome at all in the World. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, when there falleth out a Schiſme, ſo that there are two or three Popes that are together by the eares for the Popedome and Prelacie, the people are vncertaine to which of them to cleaue, and whether of them to obey.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it is falſe, that the members of the Church muſt be ſubiect to the Pope, ſeeing he is no better, nor no other, then that Antichriſt which the Scripture hath fore-ſhewed; time hath diſcouered; and the faithfull haue felt and ſuffered. Thus then we haue ſeene, that howſoeuer the Romaniſts make it a principall matter of faith, to put our heades vnder the Popes Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, to bowe our knees, to kiſſe his holye feete, and to feare the Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts of his wrath, yet all his iuriſdiction is beſides the Scriptures; nay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Scriptures: ſeeing <hi>Peters</hi> Byſhopprick and being at Rome is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vncertaine. To ſay no more: If then it be vncertain whether <hi>Peter</hi> were euer at Rome, then it muſt alſo be vncertaine, whether hee were Byſhop of Rome; and if it be vncertaine whether he were euer Byſhop of Rome, then it muſt alſo be vncertaine whether the Pope bee Byſhop of Rome, and his ſucceſſor in that Sea; and if the Popes ſucceſſion and Dominion ouer the Church be vncertaine, his Triple Crowne ſhaketh, and beginneth to totter: all which waighty burthens, do hang by a twines-thred of <hi>Peters</hi> beeing at Rome, which hath no foot-ſtep or foundation in the Scriptures. True it is,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:7222:249"/> we dare not directly and peremptorily ſay, that he was neuer at Rome; wee know how hard a thing it is to prooue a negatiue, yet it is more likely and probable, that he was neuer there, then that he was euer there; the Scriptures being Iudges. Who would willingly trauaile in a blinde and vncertaine way, where he cannot be aſſured whether he goe right or wrong? But ſuch is the iourney that the popiſh paſſengers enter into, they walke in vnknown pathes, and tread the Mazes of many doubtfull ſteps.</p>
               <p>The Popiſh Writers cannot agree <note n="r" place="margin">

Thus we ſee, how weak and wofull a Religion the Romiſh Religion is, and vpon what ſilly and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die foundations it reſteth. Let vs leaue theſe vncertaine by pathes, and tread in the beaten way of the Scripture, which cannot deceiue: let vs build our faith vpon the rocke which cannot be ſhaken, and forſake that Church that goeth a way ſhe knoweth not, and leadeth her Children ſhee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not whether, and teacheth them to receiue ſhe knoweth not what, and beleeueth thoſe things which ſhe cannot proue.

                  <hi>Greet ye one another with the kiſſe of loue.</hi> If we would maintaine loue, we muſt wiſely and carefully entertaine ſuch helpes as may further vs in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmance of that duty, whereof this that now we ſpeake off is one: ſo that we are to expreſſe our inward loue by outward tokens, to the end it may bee ſeene and appeare vnto others.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 2</note> Secondly, our ſalutations are remembrances of our care and good affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions toward theſe whom we greet well. It is a ſigne that wee are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull of them, but doe greatly regard and reſpect them. This doth the Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> ſignifie, Coloſ. 4, 12. <hi>Epaphras the ſeruant of Chriſt, which is one of you,</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Col. 4, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>ſaluteth you, and alwaies ſtriueth for you in praiers, that ye may ſtand perfect and full in all the will of God.</hi> Where we ſee, he ioyneth theſe two thinges together, as depending one vpon the other, his ſaluting of them, and his praying for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſon 3.</note> Laſtly, to deſire the good of others from the heart, is both a fruit of the ſpirit, and a good ſigne and teſtimony to our owne ſelues that we are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen of God to eternall life. To this purpoſe the Apoſtle numbring vp ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny notable fruits of the ſpirit, maketh mention <note n="c" place="margin">Gal 5, 22.</note> of <hi>Loue, Peace, Gentleneſſe, Goodneſſe, meekneſſe, Long Suffering.</hi> And in another place, he exhorteth them <note n="d" place="margin">Col. 3, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>as the elect of God, holy, and beloued, to put on the bowels of mercies, Kindneſſe, Humbleneſſe of minde, Meekneſſe, Long-Suffering, Forbearing one another, and forgiuing one another.</hi> So then, if we ſhall conſider that cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſpeeches are tokens of loue, remembrances of our affection, fruits of the ſpirit, and teſtimonies of our election, we may conclude, that it is the duty of one Church to wiſh well to another, and of one Chriſtian to ſpeake kindly to another.</p>
               <p>We haue heard the Doctrine confirmed, but before we come to the vſes that ariſe from hence, it ſhall not be amiſſe briefly to anſweare an Obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or two that may ſtand in our way, which may ſeeme to reſtraine and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that which heere is commanded and allowed. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection 1.</note> We read in the booke of the Kings, that when <hi>Elliſha</hi> ſent his ſeruant <hi>Gehazi</hi> to the <hi>Shunamites</hi> houſe, <note n="e" place="margin">2. King. 4, 29. Luke. 10, 4.</note> he bad him if he met any, not to ſalute him: and if any man ſaluted him, he ſhould anſwere him nothing.

The intent of the Prophet ſpeaking to his ſeruant, and of Chriſt to his Diſciples, is to enioyne thoſe perſons to omit for that time the practiſe of duties of common curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and ciuility, ſo farre forth as they might ſtay or any way delay the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmance of waightier affaires enioyned vnto them.

So then, the meaning of the places is not ſimply and abſolutely to forbid men to ſalute others, but ſo farre to require the omitting of it, as it ſhould be a let and an impediment vnto them in doing their duties.</p>

                  <hi>Bee ye courteous one to another, and tender-hearted.</hi> This is the commendation of <hi>Gideon,</hi> againſt the rage of the <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emites,</hi> that were greeuouſly incenſed, and ſharpely ſet againſt him; hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them mildly and gently, <note n="i" place="margin">Iudges 8, 3.</note> and thereby their ſpirits abated towardes him.

               <p>This is a Vertue hard to be found in theſe daies among the ſons of men, they cannot ſpeake well one of another. This gentleneſſe that teacheth vs to deale courteouſly toward each other, is thinly ſowne in the furrowes of our hearts. Wherefore, wee muſt know that humanity and courteous dealing are not (as ſome immagine) excluded from Chriſtians, as if nothing ſhould be in them, but rigor and auſterity. Indeede they are to deale roughly and rigorouſly with wilfull and wicked men, that are offenſiue and vnruly, but we muſt be gentle, meeke, and lowly toward ſuch as are willing to bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. Hence then it appeareth, that our common formes of ſalutation are commendable, both practiſed by worde of mouth, and vſed in writing, ſtanding vpon the warrant of Gods word, and example of the faithfull. Let vs therefore accuſtom our tongues to ciuility, to bleſſing, &amp; wiſhing al good one to another. This becommeth our profeſsion, and witneſſeth to all the world, that we are of pure conuerſation.</p>

                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 2.</note> Secondly, this Doctrine ſerueth for reproofe of diuers and ſundry abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that are too rife and common among vs. It ſeemeth a light and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing to many, to ſalute, and to be ſaluted, but it is of great force, and auaileth much to the obtaining and getting of good will. It is a point of courteſie and humanity to ſalute others, and to pray for them. Let no man ſay theſe are very ſmall and ſlender matters to be ſpoken of, and ſtood vpon. We muſt acknowledge that our obedience is to be ſhewed euen in the leaſt, and not in the greateſt matters onely. And a true Chriſtian is to bee ſeene and knowne, when he will yeeld in the practiſe of leſſer points, and ſuch as are not of greateſt importance. Wherefore, ſeeing euerie Chriſtian muſt thus behaue himſelfe, it reproueth diuers ſorts of men.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſuch as are ſo ſtrongly poſſeſſed, and rankely ouer-grown with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and reuenge, that they neither will ſalute ſuch as they meet, nor anſwer
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:7222:251"/> ſuch as ſalute them. Theſe men are dainty of their ſpeech, and as ſparing of their wordes, as if euery word of their mouth were worth a wedge of Gold. Hence it is, that many ſtand vpon termes of their reputation, and looke to haue others bend vnto them; they ſay, <note n="k" place="margin" type="runSum">Some pinch curteſie, who ſhall begin to ſpeake and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute firſt.</note> Why ſhould I ſalute him firſt? Or wherefore ſhould I beginne to ſpeake vnto him? Shall I yeeld my ſelfe or bring my ſelfe vnder him to be made his Foot-ſtoole? I will not ſtoope or bow downe: he hath firſt wronged me, let him therefore firſt ſeeke to be reconciled: and if I ſhould ſpeake to him, I know he will not anſweare me, nor looke toward me. Theſe are goodly pretences and coulourable ſhiftings to maintaine Hatred, Diſpleaſure, and priuy Grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings one againſt another, and cauſe vs to pinch curteſie who ſhall beginne to deale curteouſly one with another. But art thou reſolued, that thou wilt not beginne firſt, and as it were breake the yee, but wait vntill another beginne to ſalute thee? Thou muſt conſider that the very <hi>Publicans and Sinners do the ſame,</hi> as our Sauiour teacheth Math. 5, 46, 47. <note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 5. 46, 47.</note> 
                  <hi>If yee loue them which loue you, what reward ſhall yee haue? Do not the Publicans euen the ſame? And if ye be friendly to your Brethren onely, what ſingular thing doe yee? Do not euen the Publicans likewiſe?</hi> Wilt thou not yeeld and giue place firſt? Be conſtant, and ſetled, and vnmooueable in a good thing: but in keeping an old grudge or a new diſpleaſure, a goodman ought not to be ſtubborne and obſtinate to continue therein for euer. Doeſt thou thinke it a ſhame and reproach to thee, to change thy minde. Who doth ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme and iudge? Doth God? No, he accounteth it thy greateſt honour to yeeld to that which he commandeth. Doe the godly among whom thou liueſt? No, thou ſhalt reioyce them, and giue good example to other, and and heape coales of fire vpon their heads whom thou haſt offended, and giue a ſound teſtimony of thy vnfained loue to thy brother that hath offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thee. Hath he hurt thee firſt, and done thee wrong? Be it ſo: hee hath done euill, euery man will confeſſe it, no man will deny it, no man can defend it. Doe thou good to him againe for his euill, and prouoke him by thy example, and do that which becommeth thee, without looking wherein he faileth.</p>
               <p>Let vs ſeeke to be like our Heauenly Father, who maketh his Sunne to ariſe vpon the euill and good: and ſendeth Raine on the iuſt and vniuſt. It is a common thing in ſuch as are rich and mighty, to paſſe by the poore, and neuer or ſeeldome vouchſafe them a word of their mouth which coſteth them nothing. It is a praiſe and commendation to be honourable, yet humble. A proud heart teſtified by a ſcornefull eye and a ſilent tongue, is to be reprooued, whereſoeuer and in whomſoeuer it be found. On the other ſide, it is a great encouragement to men of the lower ſort, when ſuch as are great and mighty in the world, doe kindly ſalute them, and friendly ſpeake vnto them: they are greatly affected at it, they are mooued to loue them, and ſtirred vp to be cheerefull in well doing, when they ſee they are regarded, and not deſpiſed, or accounted baſe in their eyes, nor reſpected as their Foot-ſtoole.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſuch as are reprooued make an outward ſhew of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmance of this duty, but inwardly are as farre, and ſome-times farther from the right practiſe of it then the former. Theſe are ſuch as are true Chriſtians in name, but not in deed: in ſhew, but not in ſubſtance; in word, but not in heart. Theſe haue Charity in their lippes, but enmity in their ſoules. They ſpeake of peace, but they nouriſh hatred. A man would iudge them to be the flower of curteſie, and to haue all couplements of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity in them, and yet nowithſtanding, all this is but a maske and vizard to colour their hipocriſie. Theſe are a moſt vile and wicked kinde of men, that haue ſweete and ſugred tongues, but malicious and enuious hearts, and
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:7222:251" rendition="simple:additions"/> full of venom. This we ſee in <hi>Ioab,</hi> 
                  <note n="m" place="margin">2 Sam. 3, 27. and 20. 9.</note> who tooke <hi>Abner</hi> aſide in the Gate to <hi>ſpeake with him peaceably, and ſmote him vnder the fift rib, that he died:</hi> and likewiſe he dealt with <hi>Amaſa,</hi> he ſaid to him, <hi>Art thou in health my Brother, and tooke him by the Beard with the right hand, to kiſſe him: but with the other hand he ſmote him with the ſword, and ſhed out his bowels to the ground.</hi> The like ſalutation we ſee in <hi>Iudas,</hi> who had giuen the multitude that came with ſwords and ſtaues from the High-Prieſts and Elders of the people, a Token, ſaying, <note n="n" place="margin">Mat, 26, 48. 49.</note> 
                  <hi>Whomſoeuer I ſhall kiſſe, that is he, lay hold on him: and forthwith hee came to Ieſus and ſaid, God ſaue thee Maiſter, and kiſſed him.</hi> Thus hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed the ſonne of man with a kiſſe.</p>
               <p>We muſt haue our words and hearts goe together, and not one wander and ſtray from the other. We muſt not haue our words ſofter then Oyle, &amp; hide ſwords and ſpeares within vs. This is cruell and deceitfull dealing; this is farre from true Chriſtianity; this is farre from that plaine and ſimple dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that ought to be in vs. Such men are the moſt dangerous and perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enemies that are, they are hardly knowne, and therefore hardly auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. One of theſe falſe hearted Brethren, is worſe then an hundred open &amp; profeſſed aduerſaries. A pit which is couered, ſo that thou canſt not ſee it, is more likely to worke thy hurt, and cauſe thee to fall into it, then that which is manifeſt to be ſeene. Let vs therefore remember, that our words bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſeaſoned and accompanied with truth. Let our mouth ſpeak as the heart thinketh; and let vs take heed of lying, cogging, cozening, glozing, ſmoothing, and diſſembling, which are the workes of the deuill, &amp; the fruits of the fleſh, and the badges of Hypocrites.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as we haue heard that they are to be reproued, that diſdaine to ſpeake to others; and ſuch as are content to vſe friendly greetings in word, but their hearts go not with them: ſo likewiſe, ſuch are condemned as vſe vnkinde and vncourteous ſpeeches; nay foule and vncleane, vngodly and prophane communication. This the Apoſtle teacheth, <hi>Epheſ,</hi> 4. <note n="o" place="margin">Ephe. 4, 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Let all bitterneſſe and anger, and wrath, crying, and euill ſpeaking be put away from you, with all maliciouſneſſe.</hi> Such was the ſnappiſh anſwere of <hi>Caine,</hi> 
                  <note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 4, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Am I my Brothers keeper?</hi> So for this cauſe <hi>Nabell</hi> being a churliſh &amp; curriſh man, <note n="q" place="margin">1 Sam. 25, 10, 11.</note> is concluded to be a foole and a wicked man.</p>
               <p>This vnciuill &amp; bitter dealing, is a great ſigne, and a certaine note of an vnregenerate and carnal man. Let vs beware of al railing &amp; rotten ſpeeches. The mouth is the Meſſenger of the heart, and from the aboundance of the heart, the mouth ſpeaketh. A filthy tongue, argueth a filthy heart: an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brideled tongue, a licentious heart. A poyſoned tongue, that caſteth out banning and curſing, doth manifeſt a curſed and corrupt heart. The tongue that raueth and rageth beyond all meaſure, and belcheth out blaſphemies, and vomiteth out pocky and plaguy ſpeech (as it were) the ouer-charging of a loathſome ſtomacke, doth ſhew (be it ſpoken with reuerence) a pocky and plaguy heart.</p>
               <p>It is a ſhame almoſt to ſpeake thoſe thinges, I will not ſay which theſe men do in ſecret, but which they ſpeake openly, publickely, euidently. And yet (alas) how common a thing is it (when men and women are a little hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and prouoked) to wiſh all euill to fall vpon the perſons of their Brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and their Cattle; nay ſometimes vpon their owne wiues, their own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, their owne Seruants, their owne Cattell, crying out a vengeance on them, a plague of God to come vpon them, a Murraine take them, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill of hell go with thee, and ſuch like; which come from an vncircumciſed mouth, nay from an vncircumciſed and vnregenerate. Neyther, let any alledge for the excuſe of their curſed and wretched ſpeeches, <hi>It is a cuſtome they haue gotten, but that they minde and meane no ſuch thing, whatſoeuer they ſpeake;</hi> for firſt, this is a curſed cuſtome: and a cuſtome in ſinning, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:7222:252"/> it is, the worſe it is. The more thou doeſt accuſtome thy tongue vnto it, the harder it is to be left. Our Sauiour teacheth, <note n="r" place="margin">Mat. 12, 35. 36.</note> that <hi>A good man out of the good Treaſure of his heart bringeth forth good thinges: and an euill man out of an euill Treaſure bringeth forth euill thinge: But I ſay vnto you, that of euery idle word that men ſhall ſpeake, they ſhall giue account thereof at the day of Iudgement.</hi> If then we muſt reckon and account at the end of the World and of our life for idle wordes; what madneſſe is it for vs to caſt out and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorge blaſphemous, wicked, and curſed ſpeeches, which will bring vpon vs horrible plagues and heauy puniſhments to be ſuffered in hell fire? Hence it is, that Chriſt ſaith in the wordes following, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Verſe. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>By thy wordes thou ſhalt be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and by thy wordes thou ſhalt be condemned.</hi> Heere-unto the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> agreeth, <note n="t" place="margin">Iam. 1. 26.</note> Chap. 1. <hi>If any man among you ſeemeth Religious, and refraineth not his tongue, but deceiueth his owne heart, this mans Religion is vaine.</hi> Neither let them ſay, they thinke not euill, they meane not as they ſpeake: for this doth not take away the euill, but rather increaſe it, in aſmuch as they adde ſinne vnto ſinne, hypocriſie to impiety; as it were drunkenneſſe vnto thirſt. Let ſuch acquaint their hearts with bleſſiing, not with curſing: and ſtriue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their corruptions which are growne to an head and haue gotten a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome in them, remembring the ſaying of the Prophet, Pſal. 109. <note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 109, 17, 18.</note>

                  <hi>Set a watch (ô Lord) before my mouth, and keepe the doore of my lippes:</hi> Declaring thereby, that of our ſelues we are not able to gouerne our tongues. And againe he ſaith elſe-where; <note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 51, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>O Lord, open thou my lippes, and my mouth ſhall ſhew forth thy praiſe.</hi> If God do not open our mouths, we can neuer order our tongues as we ought. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſpeake, we muſt diligently conſider what we ſpeake, and to what end. The Wiſe-man telleth vs, <note n="e" place="margin">Prou. 18, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>That he which anſwereth a matter before he heare it, it is folly and ſhame to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this purpoſe the Apoſtle teacheth vs, <hi>To be ſlow to ſpeake, and ſwift to heare.</hi> This vertue appeared notably in <hi>Elihu, Iob</hi> 32. <hi>Who waited till Iob had spoken, for they were more auncient in yeares then hee.</hi> In our ſpeaking, we muſt be carefull that our wordes be gracious, and ſeaſoned with wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, truth, reuerence, modeſty, meekeneſſe, and ſobrietie, as it were with Salt, which are contrary to the fooliſh, rotten, and graceleſſe talke that aboundeth in our dayes; wherein men are growne to be very Beaſts, <note n="f" place="margin">Ro. 3, 13, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Their Throat is an open Sepulcher, they vſe their tongues to deceit, the Poyſon of Aspes is vnder their Lippes, their Mouth is full of curſing and bitterneſſe.</hi> Nay, the venome and Poyſon of their tongues, is worſe then the poyſon of Serpents: and yet they would thinke themſelues greatly wronged if they ſhould be charged to be as a Brood of Adders, and a Generation of Vipers. For who knoweth not that the Serpent cannot hurt a man, except he be preſent to ſee him and bite him: but ſuch as haue not learned to rule the tongue that is vnruly, and to gouerne it from breaking out into vngodly and curſſed ſpeaking (which is the Deuils Language) doe hurt men as well abſent as preſent; as well farre off, as neere at hand; as much when they are from them, as when they are with them. The holy vſe of the tongue is the <note n="g" place="margin">Eſay 19, 18.</note> language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which we muſt all couet to ſpeake, that it may bee ordered according to the Word and will of GOD. But when the tongue, which is an excellent Member, giuen vnto vs of God to praiſe and glorifie his Name, is abuſed, <note n="h" place="margin">Iames 3, 6.</note> it is kindled by the fire of Hell; according to the ſaying of the Apoſtle <hi>Iames,</hi> Chapter 3. <hi>The Tongue is Fire; yea, a World of wickedneſſe: ſo is the Tongue ſet among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and ſetteth on fire the courſe of Nature, and it is ſet on Fire of Hell.</hi> This he ſetteth foorth more at large in the wordes following, and exhorteth vs, that the harder it is to rule the tongue, the more care we ſhould vſe in the gouernment of it, and apply it to the honour of God, and the good of our Neighbour.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that he reprooueth thoſe that one while are bleſſing, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while are curſing with it, blowing ſometimes hot, and ſometimes cold, ſometimes praying to God, and anone rayling at, and reuiling their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren; <note n="i" place="margin">Iam. 3, 10, 11</note>

Doth a Fountaine ſend forth out of one place ſweete Water and Bitter? &amp;c.</hi> Let vs then vſe ſuch meekneſſe and moderation in our ſpeech, as that we doe not breake out into Choller: let our anſweres be ſoft and milde, that anger be not kindled, nor encreaſed, nor continued. If any ſhall reuile vs, and rage againſt vs, our dutie is to bleſſe, and not to raile. This is the Commaundement of Chriſt, <note n="k" place="margin">Math. 5, 44.</note>

<pb n="478" facs="tcp:7222:253"/> as ought not to be, nor to breake out among Brethren. We ought to bee of a patient Nature, and follow the example of God, who beareth with vs al. The Apoſtle <hi>Iude</hi> affirmeth, <note n="m" place="margin">Iude 9.</note>

Be it, that we haue to deale with bad men, and ſuch as are notoriouſlie euill, yet we muſt not take liberty to our ſelues to vſe reuiling ſpeeches, to brawle, and contend, ſeeing the Angell would not do it, and he would not do it againſt a worſe aduerſary then wee haue, or can haue any.

When we ſee any not ſo conſtant in the truth as they ought, and we deſire, we muſt not by and by ſhake them off, or ſtand aloofe from them, but rather ſtrengthen and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them, and make much of them. This practiſe is commaunded vnto vs in ſundry places. The Apoſtle exhorteth heereunto; <note n="p" place="margin">Ro. 14, 1, 10</note> 
                  <hi>Him that is weake in the Faith receiue vnto you, but not for Controuerſies of disputations: Why dost thou condemne thy Brother, or why dost thou diſpiſe thy Brother?</hi> And in another place of the ſame Epiſtle, <note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 15, 1.</note>

                  <hi>We deſire you, Brethren, admoniſh them that are out of order: comfort the feeble-minded: beare with the weake: be patient toward all men.</hi> To theſe Commaundements, we may adde ſundry examples of the faithfull, that haue giuen vs an example to follow.

                  <hi>A bruiſed Reede ſhall he not breake, and ſmoaking flax ſhall he not quench, till he bring forth iudgement vnto victory.</hi> This appeareth, in his louing calling of all vnto him that are weary and heauy laden, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to eaſe them, and refreſh them: ſo that hee refuſed not the company of Publicans and Sinners.

The Apoſtle writing to the <hi>Romanes</hi> Chap. 14. and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them not to ſhun, but to take into their company him that is weake in the faith, giueth this as a reaſon, <note n="u" place="margin">Rom. 14, 4.</note>

It is no wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to lay a great and heauy loade vpon the backe of a weake Beaſt, leaſt his backe be broken, and the burthen miſcarry, and the Maiſter be diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

When the bodie is feeble and ſickly, we doe not vſe to ſtarue it, or ſtifle it; but to cherriſh it, to dyet it, and keepe it warme. So ought it to be in the members of Chriſtes body, when we ſee any ſtand at a ſtay, and as it were begin to pine and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, we ſhould bring them home into the Sheepefold of Chriſt: when we ſee any wounded, we ſhould binde vp their wounds, and poure in Oyle and Balme to refreſh them: wee muſt ſeeke them that are loſt, and gather them that are diſpierſed. As for thoſe that diſcourage and diſcountenance ſuch as are of humble and broken harts, and by their vnſeaſonable ſeuerity bring them to deſpaire, let them know, that they are no better then the very Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Deuill, who are hired as Iourney-men to doe his worke, and doe vſurpe the very office of the Deuill. He is the accuſer, hater, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuter of the faithfull, but eſpecially he ſeeketh to vndermine the weake, and to ſwallow them vp in the quicke ſandes of deſperation, without helpe or hope.

               <p>Secondly, muſt we haue a reſpect to the weake? Then we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it to be our duty, to cherriſh ſuch good things as we ſee in any of our Brethren, remembring the ſaying of our Sauiour, <hi>Math.</hi> 18, 33. <hi>Oughteſt not thou alſo to haue had pitty on thy fellow-ſeruant, euen as I had pitty on thee?</hi> God doth ſhew mercy and pittie vpon vs; and therefore, if we will bee his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, we muſt not be vnlike our heauenly Father. Such is the ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of men, that whetherſoeuer we turne vs, wee cannot but ſee ſome of our Brethren feeble and fainting, and ready to ſinke vnder the burthen; ſo that they are ready to periſh, vnleſſe we put vnder our hand to vphold them. In this reſpect, ſo many as are members of the Church, ought to be ſo many Phyſitians one to another, that we may bee meanes of curing and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one another. We are charged to be keepers of them, to look vnto them, and by all good meanes to tender their good. It is an excellent precept gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6, 1, 2. <hi>Brethren, if a man be ſuddenly taken in any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, ye which are spiritual, reſtore ſuch one with the ſpirit of meekeneſſe, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thy ſelfe, leaſt thou alſo be tempted: beare yee one anothers burthen, and ſo fulfill the Law of Chriſt.</hi> Where we ſee the Apoſtle vrgeth vs to this duty by putting vs in minde of our owne infirmity. We ſo ſtand to day, as that wee are readie to fall to morrow; nay, we continue this houre, that we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to giue ouer the next. Yea, ſuch is the mercy of God oftentimes toward ſuch as are weake ones, that when he hath made them once to ſee their own frailties, he maketh them at the laſt ſtronger, and more ſtedfaſt in the Faith, then ſuch as ſeemed to bee more forward, and many degrees before them. How weake was <hi>Nicodemus?</hi> He <note n="i" place="margin">Iohn 3, 2.</note> came to Ieſus by night at the firſt, hee had a good deſire to be inſtructed, but he was ignorant in the principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, he durſt not ſhew himſelfe openly to bee his Diſciple for feare of the Iewes.</p>
               <p>The like wee might ſay of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> another Diſciple of Chriſt, <note n="k" place="margin">Iohn 19, 38.</note> (but ſecretly to auoid danger;) notwithſtanding God did ſo bleſſe them both with encreaſe of ſtrength, and the ſpirit of courage and boldnes, that the little light of Grace and ſpark of Faith that was in them, did ſo ſhine and breake out into ſuch a flame, that they were not aſhamed to profeſſe themſelues to be his Diſciples: when the reſt forſooke him, they begged his body of <hi>Pilate,</hi> they wrapped it in linnen cloaths, with Myrrhe, and Alloes, and ſweet Odours, and beſtowed the honour of buriall vpon him. Thus it falleth out oftentimes, that they which are firſt are laſt, and the laſt are firſt. We know not what ſtormes and Tempeſtes hang ouer our owne heades, and what perillous times may come vppon vs: we know not what weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe wee ſhall ſhew in them, howe great the Rebellion of the Fleſh will be, and what comfort wee ſhall want our ſelues.

                  <hi>Bleſſed, that iudgeth Wiſely of the poore, and promiſeth that the Lord ſhall deliuer him in the time of trouble.</hi> If wee haue any feeling of this happineſſe, or haue anie Faith in our hearts touching this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, let vs make it manifeſt, by ſeeking the good of our weake Bretheren. It is an hiddeous and horrible cruelty and out-rage by our want of mercy, and of feeling their infirmities, to hinder the ſaluation of any one for whom Chriſt died.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, Rom. 15, 2, 3. <hi>Let euerie man pleaſe his Neighbour, in that which is good, to edification: for Chriſt alſo would not pleaſe himſelfe, but as it is Written, The rebukes of them that rebuked thee, fell on me.</hi> It coſt a great price to Redeeme a ſoule, and to bring it from Death to Life; from Hell to Heauen; and therefore, we muſt vſe all meanes (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Lorde ſhall enable vs) to comfort ſuch as are Comfortleſſe, by the Comfort where-with wee our ſelues are comforted of God. There is no Man but deſireth to finde Peace and Comfort in him-ſelfe. What
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:7222:255"/> is this life of ours without it? If a man ſhould liue many thouſand yeares vpon the face of the earth, and haue experience of nothing but ſorrow, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, miſery, and vexation of Spirit, ſo that hee could feele no quietneſſe, no reſt, no conſolation, no tranquility in theſe daies of his Pilgrimage: would he not deſire to be out of ſuch a life, and preferre death before it? Do we then wiſh for peace? And would we finde comfort? The greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the World that can come vnto vs, and refreſh and cheere vppe our Soules, is to winne and ſaue Soules. Bleſſed are we, if we haue beene In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to gaine but one Soule vnto God. It is the greateſt gaine; it is the beſt Traffique; it is the ſweeteſt Marchandize. It ſhall be ſaid vnto vs in the laſt day; Thou good and faithfull Seruant, well done: thou haſt beene faithfull ouer little, I will make thee Ruler ouer much, enter into thy Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ioy. Let vs ſet this before our eyes, and conſider before hand the price of the reward, when the time of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord.</p>

True it is, there are degrees of Faith, all haue not one meaſure of Grace; and yet the leaſt meaſure, if it be but as a graine of Muſtard-ſeede, is of power to ſaue our Soules. If there be wrought in vs by the ſanctifying Spirit of God, the beginnings and ſeeds of Faith; to wit, an humbling of our ſelues vnder the burthen of our ſinnes, an acknowledgement and feeling that we ſtand in neede of Chriſt, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring and longing deſire to be made partaker of Chriſt and all his merrits, and a flying to the Throne of Grace from the ſentence of the Law, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the conſcience, trembling vnder the ſame: if theſe preparations (as it it were ploughings vp of the furrowes of our hearts) be found in vs, God will not caſt vs away, but make this weake meaſure of Grace to be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to ſaluation.

Not that we ſhould flatter our ſelues in our wantes, or content our ſelues in our weakeneſſe, to ſtand alwaies at one ſtay: but heereby to be brought forward in well-doing, and to runne the race with all cheerefulneſſe that is ſet before vs.</p>
               <p>This a notable ſigne of a true and ſincere hart, when we feele our ſtrength to come euery day vnto vs, and an acceſſe to be added to our former courſe. For if we deſire to be better and better, and deale as men that runne in a race, who ſtand not ſtill in the mid-way, but preſſe with might and maine to the marke: this is an infallible note of a ſincere heart. This is it which the Apoſtle teſtifieth. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3, 14, 15. <hi>Bretheren, I count not my ſelfe, that I haue attained to it, but one thing I doe: I forget that which is behinde, and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour my ſelfe vnto that which is before, And follow hard toward the marke, for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Ieſus.</hi> It is the goodneſſe of God to accept the ſmall meaſure of Faith that we bring vnto him. This graunteth not liberty vnto vs to doe nothing, to ſtirre neither hand nor foote, or to content our ſelues that we go not backward. For we muſt all know and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that the beginnings of grace are deceitfull and counterfeit, vnleſſe there be a growth and encreaſe.</p>
               <p>The kingdome of Heauen is like to <note n="q" place="margin">Math. 13, 31, 33.</note> a graine of Muſtard ſeed, which at the firſt is ſo ſmall and little, that it is ſcarſe diſcerned, but after that it is caſt

It is like vnto Leauen, which a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man taketh and hideth in three peckes of Meale, till all be Leauened.

                  <hi>I put thee in remembrance that thou ſtirre vp the gift of God which is thee, by the putting on of mine handes.</hi> The word is a borrowed ſpeach from the fire, which muſt bee euermore kindled and kept with a new ſupply from going out. If a man ſee his Corne that is in the fielde ſtand at a ſtay, and not ſhoote forward, he conceiueth little hope of any plentifull Harueſt. If we ſet a Scholler to Schoole, and he alwaies continue in the ſame forme, and neuer come forth in his learning, we will by and by coniecture, he will prooue a Dunce. Or if we ſee a Child that doth not grow in ſtrength and ſtature, we vſe to ſay; he will neuer be a tall man; he will neuer be but a Dwarfe. So is it with all thoſe that haue <note n="ſ" place="margin">Ieremy 4, 4.</note> had the plough of Gods word brought in among them, and the ground of their hearts ſowed with the precious and immortall ſeed <note n="t" place="margin">Luke 8, 11.</note> of the word, and their hearts moyſtned with a gratious raine, <note n="u" place="margin">Deut. 32, 2.</note> as it were the ſhowre vpon the hearbs, and yet continue dry and barren without any fruit; it is to be feared, that they will ſhortly fall backe and wither away.

And would we haue eyes to ſee them, and iudgement to diſcerne them? Behold heere a plaine marke and euident token to bring vs to a perfect vnderſtanding of them; they ſhall not alwaies deceiue the Church, they ſhall not alwaies couer their faces with the Vizard of holineſſe; they ſhall in the end be made euident to all men, that euery one may point at them with the finger, and ſay; This is an Hypocrite, this is a Diſſembler, this is he that went about to deceiue both God and Man, but now he is reueiled, that al men may looke vpon him, and hiſſe at him. On the other ſide, it is a notable priuiledge of a man truely ſanctified, to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and continually ſet vpon good thinges, to perſeuer in good things, and neuer to repent of the doing of them: he buildeth his houſe vpon the rock, and therefore no blaſts or tempeſts of temptation can ouerthrow it. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth the ſeede into good ground, and therefore it taketh roote downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and beareth fruit vpward with patience, he is carefull to pleaſe God in the duties of both Tables, both of holineſſe and true righteouſneſſe, and therefore he ſhall neuer be remoued.</p>

                  <hi>Simon Magus himſelfe beleeued alſo, and was baptized, and continued with Phillip, &amp; wondered when he ſaw the ſignes and great Myracles which were done:</hi> yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this embracing of the faith, was but as the flaſh of Lightning, which ſuddainly appeareth, and preſently vaniſheth, as appeareth by his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of money to buy the Graces of the Spirit, <note n="u" place="margin">Verſe 20, 23.</note> and by the anſwer of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> denouncing an horrible curſe againſt him, renouncing him for hauing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part or fellowſhip in that buſineſſe, diſcouering the hypocriſie of his hart, and manifeſting to all men that he was in the gall of bitterneſſe, and in the bond of iniquity.</p>
               <p>The like we might ſay of <hi>Hymenens, Phyletus,</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi>

Let vs all heerby be wiſe and warned, and take heed that we build not vpon men, leaſt the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation ſinking and ſhrinking downe, we fall and periſh with it. True it is, they ſhall greatly be puniſhed, that lay a ſtumbling-blocke before others, &amp; giue occaſion vnto them to fall &amp; to depart from the faith; yea, it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that a Mill-ſtone were hanged about their necke, and they drowned in the ſea, then one of the members of Chriſt be offended. Woe therefore ſhall be to thoſe that giue a ſcandall to the Church; yet ſuch as follow them, and forſake the fellowſhip of the Saints, through their euill example, cannot be excuſed.</p>
               <p>Wilt thou refuſe thy Corne, becauſe thou ſeeſt much Chaffe and Traſh mingled with it? No man muſt forſake the Church, becauſe hee ſeeth offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to ariſe in it, euery man muſt labour with himſelfe to be good Corn, and then the Chaffe ſhall hurt vs nothing at all. And albeit we ſee ſome fall away and make a ſeparation euery day, the Church looſeth nothing, but is made more pure and perfect, euen as it hindreth not, nor hurteth the Wheat, that the Tares wither away. When we behold thoſe that were chiefe men, &amp; reputed as Angels in compariſon of others, to fall as Lightning from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, let vs not be diſmayed or diſcomforted thereby, though men turne as the winde and the Weather-cocke, let vs ſtand faſt, and build vpon the rock that can neuer be ſhaken. Albeit wee may point out thouſandes on the one ſide, and ten thouſand on the other ſide, let vs not feare the falling of the Church, which ſtandeth vpon a ſure and certain foundation. Thus doth the Apoſtle comfort Gods people, when ſundry made Shipwracke of their faith, and fell into Apoſtacy, <note n="x" place="margin">2 Tim. 2, 19.</note>

               <p>If men ſhew their frailty, and be as a Reede ſhaken with the winde, it is no maruell nor new thing, we reſt not vpon them, we builde not our Faith vpon our Teachers that haue beene the meanes of our conuerſion: ſo that if they ſhould reuolt and renounce the doctrine that they haue preached, we muſt not go with them, nor follow after them.

Is it a ſmall commendation to be called the fellow of ſuch an Apoſtle? Is it a little matter to be ſet vp in the middeſt of the houſe of God, as a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Lampe, or a ſhining Candle, to giue light to others in the Church? yet after all this eſtimation that was had of him, he loued the world better then the word.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore walke warily, and looke vpon our ſelues in the perſon of this <hi>Demas,</hi> as in a looking Glaſſe, who is caſt in the teeth with his imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the profit and pleaſures of this life, that hindred him in the worke wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto he was called. We muſt take heede that thinges preſent do not ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vp the loue of thinges to come, as they doe in many who wax colde and haue no deſire of the Kingdome of Heauen. Theſe are they that haue their eyes ſo dazeled and darkened with theſe flitting thinges, that they breake out in an admiration of them, and ſay: It is good for vs to be heere: but neuer thinke that theſe delights muſt haue an end, and that the world ſhalbe reſtored. The Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> teacheth vs, that the preſent eſtate of the world is like a woman in trauaile, <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 8, 22</note> Rom. 8. <hi>We know that euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture groneth with vs alſo, and trauaileth in paine together vnto this preſent.</hi> The Creatures, as now they abide, are not in their perfection by reaſon of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne (which brought in al diſorder and confuſion.)

What a ſhame then is it for vs that are the Children of God, and haue receiued the firſt fruits of the Spirit, not to draw toward perfection, and not to keepe company with the ſenceleſſe Creatures. Let vs learne ſo to loue the truth, as that we prize it aboue all corruptible thinges; that muſt haue an end, ſo as this preſent world may not ſtay vs from deſiring and longing after ſpirituall bleſſings. Among all the baites and ſnares where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with many are taken, nothing is ſo dangerous or ſo common, as the loue of this world. Take a veiw of many that did runne well, but now runne not at all, and you ſhall finde they are right <hi>Demaſſes,</hi> the world is a beame in their eyes that they cannot ſee, a Thorne in their feete, that they cannot walke, a canker in their mouthes that they cannot ſpeak, a clogge to their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that they cannot proceede, and a ſnare to their ſoules that they cannot profit or proſper in good thinges. Our daies are full of two many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of men that are fallen into a deepe ſleepe of carnall ſecurity, ſo that

Others there are, that ſhrinke backe for feare of troubles and croſſes, as it may appeare this <hi>Demas</hi> alſo did.

In the time of peace and proſperity, in quiet and ioyfull times, and in ſuch golden daies as our eyes haue ſeene, and our hearts haue enioyed, many will ſeeme, and doe ſeeme to perſeuer in the faith, and to embrace the word: but when the Sunne ariſeth in his ſtrength, and perſecution com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth for the wordes ſake, by and by they are offended. Sathan is priuy to this corruption lying hidden in our Nature. For when as God ſaid vnto him, <note n="b" place="margin">Iob 1, 8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Hast thou not conſidered my Seruant Iob, how none is like him in the Earth?

Thou haſt bleſſed the workes of his handes, and his ſubſtance is encreaſed: but ſtretch out now thine hand, and touch all that he hath, to ſee if he will not blaspheme thee to thy Face.</hi> We ſee heeerby, that God will haue thoſe that thinke they beleeue, and would haue others to thinke ſo alſo, to be tryed and knowne what they are. Doſt thou make ſhew of Religion? Doſt thou glory in thy profeſſion? It pleaſeth God to offer thee the meanes and occaſions to try thee, he ſendeth the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the tongue; thou art reuiled, ſcorned, ſlandered, and derided for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the truth, for hearing the word, for frequenting of Sermons: and then it commeth to paſſe, that rather then they with endure theſe croſſes, they ſhrinke away, and ſtrike hands will euill men, and embrace the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of this preſent euill World. Thus we ſee how Sathan buſieth himſelfe to vndermine vs, and to ouerthrow vs, and what tentations he ſetteth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs on the right hand, and on the left hand; on the right hand, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the World, and the pleaſures of the Fleſh; on the left hand, croſſes and perſecutions for the words ſake.

But let vs take heed we be not deceiued, for God will not be mocked.

                  <note n="o" place="margin">Reuel. 2, 4.</note> becauſe hee had left his firſt loue.

Laſtly, the whole Prayer is garniſhed with a certain exclamation of heartie wel-wiſhing to them in the laſt word, [<hi>Amen.</hi>] Thus much touching the Order.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the words.</note> Let vs come to the Interpretation of the Words, and ſearch out the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them by other places of Scripture. Wherein we are to conſider what is meant by grace: why it is called [<hi>The Grace of our Lord Ieſus;</hi>] why he is called [<hi>A Lord.</hi>] why [<hi>Our Lord,</hi>] what is meant by [<hi>Spirit,</hi>] what is meant by [<hi>your Spirit,</hi>] and laſtly, what is meant by this word [<hi>Amen.</hi>] Firſt, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching [<hi>Grace</hi>] (whereof we haue ſpoken before, Verſe 3.) we muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that there is a two-fold Grace mentioned in the word of God; <note n="p" place="margin">Called <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia gratu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faciens</hi>
                  </note> One, which maketh a man gracious and acceptable to God, which is the free fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and loue of God, whereby he is well pleaſed, and exceedingly conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his elect in Chriſt his beloued ſonne: which is in God himſelfe, and in no Creature whatſoeuer, either Saint or Angell. The other, is Grace freely <note n="q" place="margin">Called <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia gratis data.</hi>
                  </note> giuen to men, both common to the elect and Reprobate, or proper to the elect onely, which are ſupernaturall and ſauing graces. The former, is called the firſt Grace, which is no inharent quality in vs, but an eſſential pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in God, and the cauſe of all graces in vs, and the Fountaine of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits that flow vnto vs. Thus it is taken in many places, as Rom. 1, 7. and 3, 24. and 4, 16. and 11, 6. The latter, is called the ſecond Grace, becauſe it is deriued from the former, as we ſee 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1, 16. and 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 14. and 5, 10. and 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3, 18. Now in this place, I vnderſtande it of the fauour and Loue of GOD, with the which hee beganne his Epiſtle before, and with which heere he cloſeth it vppe, ending euen as hee made his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hee calleth this [<hi>The Grace of our Lord Ieſus Christ</hi>] for two Cauſes; firſt, becauſe he is the fountaine of it, he is as the Well-ſpring, we haue it not of our ſelues, we haue it from him, according to that which the Euangeliſt <hi>Iohn</hi> ſetteth downe, <note n="r" place="margin">Iohn 1, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Of his fulneſſe we haue all receiued, and Grace for Grace.</hi> Secondly, it is called [<hi>the Grace of Chriſt,</hi>] not of God the father, not
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:7222:260"/> of God the Holie-Ghoſt, but of Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, becauſe hee is the meanes, or as the Cunduit-pipe, whereby he it is brought and conueyed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs; Thus the ſame Euangeliſt ſpeaketh in the wordes following; <note n="ſ" place="margin">Iohn 1, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>The Law was giuen by Moſes, but Grace and Truth came by Ieſus Christ.</hi> He it is that is the Mediation and Propitiation for our ſinnes, he hath purchaſed the fauour of God, he hath wrought reconciliation for vs, ſo that through him we are accepted of God the Father, and beloued in his beloued, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we muſt conſider the Title giuen to Chriſt Ieſus, hee is called a Lord or Ruler, and that in many reſpects: Firſt, by creation, in that he made vs of nothing when we had no being, <note n="t" place="margin">Iohn 1, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>For all thinges were made by him, and without him was nothing made that was made.</hi> Secondly, by right of Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, <note n="u" place="margin">Heb. 1, 2. Pſal. 2, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>For he is made Heire of all thinges.</hi> Thirdly, by right of Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for he hath Dominion ouer all things, and ouer vs alſo; ſo that he ruleth, preſerueth, and keepeth vs as his owne to eternall life, being bought with his moſt preciour blood. None of them can bee loſt that are committed vnto him, neither can any plucke them out of his hands. All thinges are put vnder his feet, and ſubiect vnto him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he is ſaid to be our Lord; he is not onely a Lord, hauing right and might graunted vnto him ouer others, but hees called our Lord. Firſt, becauſe the Father gaue him a people and choſen Generation, ouer whom he ſhould rule. So then, by reaſon of this donation appointed vnto him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all worlds, he is truely called our Lord. Secondly, in regard of the work of redemption which he hath wrought for vs, he alone hath paid the ranſom for vs, and deliuered vs from the power of the Deuill: ſo that hee hath the greateſt right of poſſeſſion in vs. Laſtly, we are thereby put in mind, that we ought ſo to beleeue in Chriſt our Lord, that we put our truſt and confidence in him, and that we reſt throughly perſwaded, that by him we are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly freed and deliuered from all euill. It is not enough for vs, or ſufficient to ſaluation, to beleeue Chriſt Ieſus to be a Lord, but we muſt beleeue him to be our Lord. For wee all knowe and beleeue that the Deuill is a Lord, and ruleth in the hearts of the Children of diſobedience; he is the God of this. World, and a Prince that beareth great ſway: but wee doe neyther know nor beleeue him to be our Lord, as we beleeue Chriſt Ieſus to bee the Lord of vs all.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, he addeth [<hi>With your Spirit.</hi>] He craueth this Grace to be with his Spirit: whereby he meaneth as much, as if he had ſaid with you; one part of man being named for the whole, the more principall part being put for the whole perſon. For man conſiſteth of two eſſentiall parts, of Soule and Body. True it is, the Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> doth ſometimes deuide man into three partes; the Spirit, the Soule, the Body; as when he prayeth for the <hi>Theſſalonians;</hi> 
                  <note n="x" place="margin">1 Theſ. 5, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>That their whole Spirit, and Soule, and Body, ſhould be kept blameleſſe vnto the comming of our Lord Ieſus Christ.</hi> By the Spirit, he vnderſtandeth the mind, reaſon, or vnderſtanding, which elſe-where hee calleth the <note n="y" place="margin">Ephe. 4, 23. Heb. 4, 12. Ephe. 4. 17, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Spirit of your mind.</hi> This is nothing elſe but a faculty of the reaſonable ſoule, which is ſeen, in inuention and iudgement. By the the Soule, he vnderſtandeth the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or faculties and powers, as the will, and affections: both which followeth the body, which is the Inſtrument whereby the Spirit and Soule do worke. By the Spirit in this place, is not meant onely the minde, or onely the Soule, but the whole man is to be vnderſtood; as it is expounded <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 23. <hi>The Grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt be with you all.</hi> And <hi>Col.</hi> 4, 18. <hi>Grace be with you:</hi> yet he nameth the ſpirit, becauſe it is the principall ſubiect and ſeat of grace.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, the Apoſtle proceedeth and ſaith [<hi>Your spirit,</hi>] hee ſpeaketh not to <hi>Philemon</hi> alone, ſaying, [<hi>With thy Spirit;</hi>] but he enlargeth his heart, and ſaith [<hi>With your Spirit,</hi>] as ſpeaking to many. Whereby wee are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:7222:261"/> thoſe to whom this Epiſtle is written and deliuered, to wit; cheefly to <hi>Philemon,</hi> whoſe Title it beareth, and to <hi>Apphia</hi> his wife, to <hi>Archippus</hi> the Miniſter, and to the Church that was in his houſe, to all theſe he wiſheth the Grace of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, he endeth with the word [<hi>Amen,</hi>] which is as much as euen ſo, or ſo be it, or ſo it ſhall be. Indeede it is no part of the former prayer, but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokeneth and ſignifieth two things; Firſt, an hearty deſire, whereby we wiſh that we may be heard, and that God would anſwere vnto our requeſts. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the certainty of our confidence, and the confirmation of our Faith, whereby we truſt that we ſhall be heard. It is an Hebrew worde retained by the Apoſtles in their Epiſtles, and in other places, wherewith we are taught to conclude our Prayers withall, by Chriſt our Sauiour. It is added, to ſhew that we ſhould come with boldneſſe, and beleeue that we ſhall obtaine, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in the truth of Gods promiſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">The poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of the Epiſtle.</note> Hauing thus laide open the ſenſe and meaning of the wordes in this laſt Verſe, it ſhall not be amiſſe to ſpeake ſome-what of the wordes following, which are the ſubſcription and vnder-writing of this Epiſtle, in theſe wordes:
<q>
                     <hi>Written from Rome to Philemon, and ſent by Oneſimus a Seruant.</hi>
                  </q> It is moſt likely, that this Epiſtle was written and ſent at one and the ſame time, with that entituled to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> both becauſe the ſame perſons are named in both the Epiſtles, the ſame perſons writing, and the ſame perſons ſending ſalutations to others; and both of them in the <hi>Poſt-ſcript,</hi> are ſayde to be ſent by <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> as it were by a Carrier; only heerein reſteth the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that this Epiſtle was deliuered to <hi>Oneſimus</hi> alone, to bee carried to <hi>Philemon</hi> a priuate man; but the other was conueyed by <hi>Tychicus</hi> and <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus,</hi> to the whole Church of the <hi>Coloſsians,</hi> whereof <hi>Philemon</hi> and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily were but one part. But touching this ſubſcription, as alſo others in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Epiſtles, we muſt vnderſtand that they were added by men, and are no part of the Cannonicall Scripture, which is the rule of our faith, &amp; to which we muſt yeeld, without all contention or contradiction; and from which, we cannot appeale without intollerable iniury to the ſpirit of God. For, howſoeuer diuers of theſe <hi>Post-ſcripts</hi> may be true, yet it is very plaine and euident, that ſome of them are falſe, and manie of them verie vncertaine. Of this ſort, is the former Epiſtle to the Corinthians, which is ſayde to bee written from <hi>Philippi,</hi> and likewiſe to bee ſent by <hi>Stephanas</hi> and <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> &amp;c. where two thinges are auouched, and both of them ſeeme to bee falſe. For firſt, it appeareth <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 16, 5.</note> that he was not then ar <hi>Phillippi</hi> a cheefe Citty in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi> that is in <hi>Europe,</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 8. &amp; 19.</note> but at <hi>Epheſus</hi> which is in <hi>Aſia.</hi> Secondly, it may be gathered, that it was ſent by the hands of <hi>Timotheus</hi> and <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 10.</note> partly out of that Epiſtle, and partly out of the Actes of the <note n="d" place="margin">Acts, 19. 21, 22.</note> Apoſtles. The like we may ſay of the <hi>Poſt-ſcript</hi> of the latter Epiſtle; of both the Epiſtles to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> of both the Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy,</hi> of that to <hi>Titus,</hi> and others. And as we ſhew that theſe <hi>Poſt-ſcripts,</hi> whether true or falſe, were not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Apoſtles, but by ſome other men after their dayes, <note n="e" place="margin">Beza.</note> for the moſt part either vnlearned, or not ſo well aduiſed: ſo we might affirme and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the ſame touching the Inſcriptions or titles prefixed and ſet before the Epiſtles of <hi>Paule, Iames,</hi> and the reſt.</p>
               <p>For firſt, both the inſcriptions and ſubſcriptions, are variably ſet downe in Coppies, that there can no certainety be gathered out of them, which of them ſhould ſtand as Authenticall. Secondly, ſome of them haue both ſtrange and vnfit Titles; as when the ſeauen Epiſtles, written by <hi>Iames, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Iude;</hi> are called ſometimes Canonicall; and ſometimes Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Epiſtles: which are Names not found in the Scriptures, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:7222:261"/> derogatory to the reſt of the Epiſtles, as though none were Canonicall but they. Thus much ſhall ſerue and ſuffice to giue warning, both touching Inſcriptions and Subſcriptions, both which are of one ſtampe, and no part of the pure word of God: whereof more might be ſpoken, if it were eyther neceſſary, or profitable, or expedient.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obſeruations pointed out in this verſe.</note> The next point, according to the order obſerued in the former wordes, is to point out ſuch obſeruations as might be enlarged and amplified for our inſtruction. Firſt of all, we ſee heere, that as in the entrance of the Epiſtle, and as it were at their firſt meeting, he wiſhed vnto him the Grace of Chriſt, ſo he doth in the farewell and departing: thereby teaching, that nothing is better or more to be deſired then his Grace: that all our Salutations and Farewels, ſhould be grounded in his Grace: this muſt be the beginning and the ending of all our talke and communication.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when the Sonne of God is called Ieſus, wee obſerue againe that he is a perfect and abſolute Sauiour, the alone Sauiour, inaſmuch as the worke of our Saluation and Redemption is wholly and onely wrought out by him, and no part left vnfiniſhed, and reſerued for any Creature in heauen or in earth: <note n="f" place="margin">Acts 4, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>For among Men there is no other Name giuen vnder Heauen, whereby we may be ſaued, but by the name of Ieſus.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. <note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 7, 25.</note> 
                  <hi>He is able perfectly to ſaue them that come vnto God by him, ſeeing he euer liueth to make interceſſion for them.</hi> Let vs learne by this Name, giuen to the Sonne by the Father, and brought from Heauen by an Angell, that in our ſelues we are as loſt Sheepe, and going aſtray. We are wretched Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, lying vnder the heauy wrath of God; hee came to ſeeke and to ſaue that which is loſt. Wee are Priſoners, he came to ſet vs at liberty; we are wounded, he came to cure vs; we are dead, hee came to reſtore and reuiue vs. No man can truely and with a feeling heart ſay, Chriſt is my Sauiour, vnleſſe he finde, that without him he is vtterly loſt and caſt away. Againe, this is a wonderfull comfort to our hearts, that beeing ſhut vp vnder ſinne and condemnation, the Lord had mercy vpon vs, and made an euerlaſting Couenant of Grace with vs, that his owne Sonne ſhall bee our Redeemer. Hence it is that the Angels <note n="h" place="margin">1 Pet. 1, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Who deſire to looke into the Mysteries of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, ſo greatly reioyced when Christ was borne, and themſelues ſent to publiſh the glad tydings thereof. Luke</hi> 2. <note n="i" place="margin">Luk. 2, 10, 11</note> 
                  <hi>Behold, I bring you tydings of great ioy that ſhall be to all the people; that vnto you is borne in the Citty of Dauid a Sauiour, which is Christ the Lord.</hi> If theſe bleſſed Spirits bee thus affected at the birth of Chriſt, who came not to bee a Sauiour and Redeemer vnto them, becauſe they did want the benefit of Redemption: how much more ought we to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce whom this glorious worke doth cheefely concerne; yea ſo much, that if we wanted this Sauiour, it had beene better with the Beaſtes of the field, and the creeping thinges of the Earth, and the Fiſhes of the Sea, and the Fowles of the Ayre, then with vs, with vs (I ſay) that were fallen from him. For the end of the vnreaſonable Creature, is the ende of his woe; but the death of man without a Mediator, is the beginning of woe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Sonne of God is called Chriſt, which ſignifieth as much as annointed. In the time of the Old Teſtament, three ſorts of men were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with Materiall Oyle; Kings, Prophets, and Prieſts. This Legall annointing, was a Type and Figure of the annointing of Chriſt let is, who <note n="k" place="margin">Iohn 6, 17.</note> was ſet apart from all Eternity, to doe the Office of a Media our bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene GOD and Man, <note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 45. 7. Eſay 61, 1. Iohn 3, 34.</note> and had the fulneſſe of the Spirit powred into his Man-hoode; and therefore hee is a King, to gather and gouerne his Church; a Prophet, to reueale and teach the will of his Father; a Prieſt, to make ſatisfaction and interceſſion for the ſinnes of his people. From nence we learne, that when we are baptized into Chriſt, and are called to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Goſpell, we are after a ſort conſecrated and ſet apart to bee <note n="m" place="margin">Reuel. 1, 6.</note>
                  <pb n="496" facs="tcp:7222:262"/> ſpirituall Kings, ſpirituall Prophets, and ſpirituall Prieſts: we haue the ſame Oyle of gladneſſe, not indeed as he hath it which is without meaſure, but a ſmall pittance of it, and a little meaſure, whereby we are called Chriſtians of Chriſt; that is, men annointed with the Oyle wherewith Chriſt himſelfe was annointed, albeit in a farre inferiour degree. This the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> ſetteth downe, <note n="n" place="margin">1 Iohn, 2, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>The annointing, which ye receiued of him, dwelleth in you, &amp;c. and that ſame annointing teacheth you all thinges.</hi> Euery one pleaſeth himſelfe in the title of a Chriſtian, all men chalenge the name of Chriſtians as their proper right, and would cry out of extreame wrong, to be denied a portion in this honour: but aske them what Chriſt ſignifieth, and how themſelues become Chriſtians, they are able to anſweare nothing at all. But let vs take heede we doe not deceiue out owne heartes, and flatter our ſelues in a bare title, when the truth of the thing doth not belong vnto vs. If a poore ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Begger that hath nothing but ragges and rents to brag and boaſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe off, ſhould fooliſhly perſwade himſefe he were a King, and Monarch of the world, could this vaine opinion any whit auaile him, or miniſter any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vnto him? In like manner, if we delight to be called Chriſtians, and yet want the annointing of Chriſt, we are as farre from being true Chriſtians, as the former begger is from being a Prince of the earth. Wherefore, if wee will haue the thing, with the name, and the truth, with the title, we muſt bee as Kings, bearing ſway ouer our owne luſtes, and proclaiming continuall warre againſt the Deuill, the World, and the fleſh. We muſt thus raigne ouer our ſelues, and then we ſhall be Kings indeed. We muſt be carefull to haue the word dwell plentifully in vs, and endeuour to inſtruct others. We muſt offer vp ſpirituall ſacrifices acceptable vnto the Father; we muſt make prayers and ſupplications vnto him, and reſigne vp our ſelues, our ſoules and bodies to his ſeruice. A carnall Chriſtian that liueth in the fleſh, is no Chriſtian. An ignorant Chriſtian that walketh in darkeneſſe, is no Chriſtian. Such then, as are led by their owne luſtes, and carried away by their owne corruptions, giuing themſelues ouer to all looſeneſſe of life, are not ſpirituall Kings, but very Slaues and Bond-men, nay the baſeſt Vaſſals that breath vpon the earth. Such as are blinde in the matters of God, and haue nothing in their mindes, but groſſe ignorance, knowing nothing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nor deſiring to know nothing of the meanes of ſaluation, cannot bee ſpirituall Prophets, but ſottiſh perſons, and blinde men that are not farre from falling into the pit of deſtruction. Such as approach not to the Throne of grace with broken and contrite heartes, and call not vpon God, are not ſpirituall Prieſts, but come neerer to the prophane Athieſtes, who are ſaide, not to call vpon God, and thinke it no profit to pray vnto him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, let vs conſider the third title giuen to the Sonne of God, hee is called, our Lord: which teacheth vs to acknowledge him to be the Ruler and Gouernour of his Church, and of euery particular member thereof. And if he be the Gouernour and guide, woe vnto them that will not be ruled and gouerned by him. When he perſwadeth vs to perfourme obedience to the morrall Law, he giueth this as the reaſon <note n="o" place="margin">Exod. 20, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>I am the Lord thy God.</hi> Thus doth the Prophet bring in the lord ſpeaking vnto vs, <note n="p" place="margin">Mal. 1, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>If I be your Lord, where is my feare?</hi> We muſt therefore conforme our willes to his will, and reſigne body and ſoule to be ordered and directed by him. All men are willing to acknowledge Chriſt a redeemer, but not a Ruler: a Sauiour, but not a Lord. Euery man would gladly and willingly haue a portion in Chriſtes redemption, but they regard not to perfourme him any obedience. They are forward to heare of this Mediatorſhip: but they take no delight to heare of his Lord-ſhip: they loue not to be vnder his dominion, they care not for the bearing of his yoake, they deſire not to yeelde ſubiection to his word.

<pb n="497" facs="tcp:7222:262"/> and ſlaues to their ſinnes. Theſe are ſuch as haue another Lorde ſet ouer them, which ruleth in their hearts, to wit; the Prince of darkneſſe, and the God of this world, his workes they do, his luſts they fulfill, and to him they obey. Theſe are thoſe enemies mentioned by Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 19, 27. <hi>that will not that he ſhould raigne ouer them, who in the end ſhall be brought and ſlaine before him.</hi> Wherefore, if euer we looke to finde Chriſt our Sauiour, let vs firſt make him our Gouernour: if wee would haue him be our iuſtification, let him become alſo our ſanctification; if we would haue him eaſe vs of our burthen, and refreſh vs of our wearineſſe, we muſt take his yoake vppon vs, and ſuffer our neckes to be acquainted with it.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, obſerue that the Grace heere asked for <hi>Philemon</hi> and others, to whom the Apoſtle wrote, is called the grace of Ieſus Chriſt; to teach vs that Gods graces and benefits come vpon vs thorough him, and as nothing was made without him that was made, ſo nothing is giuen without him that is giuen. If then, we would haue right and intereſt in any of the bleſſinges of God, we muſt labour to be in Chriſt, and to haue aſſurance that wee are in Chriſt. If we touch and taſt any of them, and yet be not ingrafted into him, we are Vſurpers, and no better then Theeues and Robbers; wee haue no more right and Title to any of the Creatures or Graces of God, then the Theefe hath to the true mans purſe. Chriſt Ieſus is heire of all things, and we by him. For, if <note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 8, 17.</note> we be ſonnes, then are we heyres, euen the heires of God, and heyres annexed with Chriſt: as for the vngodly, they are Baſtards, and not ſonnes, and the Baſtard cannot inherit, hee is barred from claiming any intereſt in the inheritance.</p>
               <p>True it is, ſuch as are out of Chriſt, doe many times abound in earthly bleſſings, and they enioy Houſes, and Landes, and Temporall poſſeſſions, and they can ſhew their Writings, and Conueyances, and Leaſes, &amp; Deeds, and Euidences, how they holde their inheritances from men: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe, in the middeſt of them they are miſerable, and that for three cauſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Wicked mens caſe, euen in earthly things, is moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> Firſt, becauſe albeit they may haue many thinges, yet they can haue right to nothing, and they lay hold on ſuch things as doe not belong vnto them. God made the world, and all things therein for his own ſonnes, not for the baſe borne; for his Seruants, not the Deuils ſlaues. They are like the Moth which breedeth in another mans Garment, but is ſoone ſhaken out: the Moth hath no right to be there, and therefore is bruſhed off, or picked out, and caſt away. This is the compariſon <note n="q" place="margin">Iob 27, 16, 17, 18.</note> of the Holy-Ghoſt, teaching that all vnregenerate perſons are Intruders, and can lay no lawfull claime by the Law of God, to the thinges they poſſeſſe; and therefore, the Land-lord of the world, may and will thruſt them out at his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as their right is nothing, ſo they want the right vſe of them. If they had right vnto them, yet had no comfortable vſe of them, it were a great iudgement: but theſe men haue neither. The Apoſtle teacheth, <note n="r" place="margin">Titus 1, 15.</note> that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the pure, are all things pure: but vnto them that are defiled, and vnbeleeuing, it nothing pure, but euen their Minds and Conſciences are defiled.</hi> There is no peace to the wicked: in the midſt of ioy they are in heauineſſe, in the midſt of life they are in death, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Dan. 5, 6.</note> like <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> who in the middeſt of his Feaſt and fulneſſe, ſaw the hand-writing vpon the wall, as a Prognoſticate of his deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, albeit they haue the bleſſings of God, and keep them in bondage, yet withall they poſſeſſe the Curſſe of God, which alwaies waiteth vppon them, and is ready to ſeize vpon them. The Theefe liueth alwaies in feare of the Iudge, and of the day of Aſſiſes, ſo doe theſe men liue in continuall daunger of Gods Iudgement and punniſhment, which ſhall one day meete with them.</p>

               <p>Sixtly, obſerue that he deſireth grace to reſt in their ſpirits: and albeit he meane heeereby their whole perſons (as we haue ſhewed before in ſetting downe the Interpretation of the wordes) yet heereby he aſſigneth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Seat of Grace, to be the Soule. For the Grace of Chriſt, is an inward and ſpirituall thing, and therefore taketh vp the inward and ſpirituall part of man. Indeed, when once grace is entred into the heart, and ſitteth there as a Queen to order all our thoughts and affections, it wil ſpread it ſelfe through the whole man, and afterward as it were goe out of the dores into the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions. We ſee heereby where grace is eſpecially felt: for as the Soule is the ſubiect of it, ſo the Soule hath the eſpeciall feeling of it. Our Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, the peace of conſcience which paſſeth all vnderſtanding is felt in the Soule: yea, Glorification and eternall life throgh Ieſus Chriſt is felt in the Soule. This teacheth vs to labour earneſtly <note n="t" place="margin">Heb. 13, 9.</note> to haue grace in the heart, that from thence it may flow into all our actions. It is not enongh to haue gratious tongues, gratious wordes, gratious mouths, we muſt firſt haue grace within, and giue vnto God our heartes. Nothing is more deteſtable to God and man then Hypocriſie: there appeareth grace without, but there dwelleth none within: there is great ſhew, but little truth, or rather no truth at all.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, obſerue with me the laſt word, whereby the Apoſtle ſhutteth vp the Salutation and the whole Epiſtle, to wit, [<hi>Amen.</hi>] This is ſet downe in a word, and yet it containeth more then the prayer it ſelfe. For in prayer we teſtifie our deſire, by this we witneſſe our Faith. By this we obſerue that vnto our requeſts and petitions in prayer, muſt be ioyned Faith and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, that God will grant the thinges craued. This appeareth in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 89, 52.</note> Pſal. 89. <hi>Praiſed be the Lord for euermore, So be it, euen ſo be it.</hi> Wee are taught thus to ſhut vp our prayers, by Chriſt our Sauiour in that plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme which he hath left vs. Thus the Apoſtle cloſeth and concludeth his Epiſtle, <note n="x" place="margin">2 Cor, 13, 13</note> 
                  <hi>The grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and the loue of God, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Holy Ghoſt, be with you all, Amen.</hi> And indeed praier auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth onely in them that beleeue: <note n="y" place="margin">Iam. 1, 6, and 5, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>It is the prayer of faith preuaileth much, if it be feruent:</hi> yea, we muſt aske in faith and not wauer, if we thinke to obtaine any thing at his handes.

                  <hi>If thou canſt beleeue, all thinges are poſſible to him that beleeueth: he anſweared, Lord, I beleeue, helpe mine vnbeleefe.</hi> To pray without Faith, is not to pray at all. And to ſay Amen in the end of our prayers, and yet to pray with doubting, and without beleeuing, is to make a lie, and to teach our tongues to deceiue our hearts. For this is a great iarre and diſcord, when infidelity is in the heart, and faith in the tongue: when inwardly we wauer, and outwardly the mouth vttereth, Amen. More-ouer, ſo often as we vſe publike prayers, they muſt be pronounced and deliuered with that plaineneſſe, feeling, and zeale, as that the people, being thereby moued, and their faith and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons going with that which is deliuered and prayed for, may anſwere Amen vnto that which is deſired. This is it which the Apoſtle toucheth, 1 Cor. 14. <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 14, 15 16.</note> 
                  <hi>I will pray with the ſpirit, but I will pray with the vnderſtanding alſo: I will ſing with the ſpirit, but I will ſing with the vnderſtanding alſo: Elſe when thou bleſſeſt with the Spirit, how ſhall he that occupieth the Roome of the vnlearned, ſay, Amen at thy giuing of thankes, ſeeing he knoweth not what thou ſaieſt.</hi> This reprooueth the Popiſh and Romiſh Liturgy, that vſe in diuine ſeruice a ſtrange and vnknowne tongue, whereby the people are nuzeled in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and can receiue no <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor 14, 19, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="499" facs="tcp:7222:263"/> the deepe deuiſe of the Deuill, how farre he hath preuailed in this falſe Church. For when he ſaw he could not thus farre haue the vpper hand, as vtterly to caſt the word out of the Church, and to take away the vſe of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; when he perceiued it to be vnpoſſible to roote out the word of God, and to aboliſh the inuocation of his holy name, he fell to worke another way, and that is, to ſuffer the thinges to remaine, and to take away the right and profitable vſe of them, ſo that albeit the word is read, it is read without kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: and albeit prayers be made, yet they are made without comfort. Thus the names of the worde and prayer remaining, the benifite of them is taken away. The like we might ſay of the Sacraments, eſpecially of the Supper of the Lord: they will ſeeme to haue it, yet in truth they want it: to allow of it, and yet they deſtroy it and aboliſh it. If the Deuill ſhould vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly remoue theſe thinges out of the way, ſo that the names, neither of the word, nor of prayers, nor of the Sacraments were heard among them, all men might diſcouer this deceit, no man would eaſily be ſeduced by this pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable groſſeneſſe: but he is a more cunning worke-man, he can hide his ſnares from being ſeene, ſo that he will not haue them vtterly remooued and renounced, that the people might ſay, we haue the word reade vnto vs, wee haue good prayers ſaide among vs, we haue the Sacraments with vs, yet all is done in a ſtrange manner, the Prieſt vſeth a ſtrange tongue, and the people are nurtured in ſtrange ignorance. For the word is heard ignorantly, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are made ignorantly, and the Sacraments are receiued ignorantly. The whole frame of the Popiſh Religion is maintained by ignorance. Thus much of the generall obſeruations, that might be enlarged and farther am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified, which I haue briefly pointed out: and albeit all of them be very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, yet I will in this manner paſſe them ouer. Now let vs handle the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Doctrine that ariſeth from this Salutation.</p>

                  <q rend="inline">[<hi>The grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, be with your Spirit, Amen.</hi>]</q> This is the laſt clauſe of the Epiſtle, wherein he wiſheth the ſame that he did in the beginning, to wit, <hi>the grace of Chriſt.</hi> If there had beene any more nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or excellent bleſſing to craue and deſire for him then this grace of Chriſt, no doubt he would haue asked it, and ſhould haue obtained it for him. Hee would haue made ſome mention of it, either in the beginning or at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ending, or in ſome other place of this Epiſtle. But ſeeing we finde no other bleſſing rehearſed or required, beſide this grace of Chriſt, it is moſt certain the Apoſtle knew no greater or better guift then this grace of chriſt. And indeed, he which nameth and commendeth the grace of Chriſt, doth except or exclude nothing which is good for vs, or profitable vnto vs, either in this life, or in the life to come. For the grace of Chriſt, whereby we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the free fauour of God, which we by no duties or workes haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, or can any way deſerue, comprehendeth vnder it, as it were within the compaſſe of it, euery good thing, and euery perfect guift. For the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall bleſſings of God; as Remiſſion of ſinnes, Iuſtification, Sanctification, and eternall Life, doe all flow from this grace as from a Fountaine. Now it is called the grace of Chriſt, and that fitly and worthily; becauſe he hath obtained it for vs, by the price of his owne precious bloud he hath deſerued to haue the ſame beſtowed vpon vs. For the grace of God the Father pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belongeth vnto him, and Chriſt Ieſus, his naturall ſonne, in whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone he is well pleaſed, is the Treaſure &amp; Store-houſe of his Father, by whoſe hand is beſtowed whatſoeuer is beſtowed vpon vs.</p>

So then, if we lay theſe thinges together and conſider, that the ſpirituall bleſſings being incorruptible, and inuiſible, and eternall, are in themſelues more excellent; that they are of great force and power with God; whereas the earthly, are vaine and tranſitory, weake, and vnable to remoue any iudgement, and that Heauenly bleſſings are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the earthly, and companions with them: we may truely gather and collect from hence, that it is our duty to preferre and pray for ſpirituall things before tranſitory, for heauenly thinges before earthly, for eternall thinges before temporall.</p>

Theſe two, the loue of this world, and of the world to come, are ſo croſſe and contrary one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they cannot reſt and remaine in the higheſt degree within vs, but one cooleth and quencheth the other, one ouercommeth and ouermaſtereth the other. We would account him a foole and deſtitute of ordinary vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, a ſimple man or a very Child, that would preferre Copper before Gold, a graine of Barly before a Pearle or precious Stone, or would make choiſe of Chaffe before the Wheate, or chuſe the Huskes before the Corne, and yet there are a thouſand and ten thouſand worſe Fooles in the World, which take themſelues to be great wiſe men, prudent and politike men of deepe and profound reaches, who would diſdaine and ſcorne at it to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted either Childiſh or fooliſh. <hi>Naball</hi> was <note n="t" place="margin">1 Sam. 25. 25.</note> a rich man, and no doubt tooke himſelfe and was taken of others to be a wiſe man: yet ſetting his minde wholly vpon his goods, he is called by the Scripture a foole. The rich man mentioned in the Goſpell, <note n="u" place="margin">Luke. 12, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.</note> when his ground brought forth fruits plentifully, thought with himſelfe, <hi>I will pull downe my Barnes and build grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and ſaide to his Soule, <hi>Soule, thou haſt much goods laid vp for many yeares, liue at eaſe, eate, drinke, and take thy paſtime:</hi> but though he were rich, and therefore thought himſelfe wiſe, yet <hi>God ſaide vnto him, O foole, this night will they fetch away thy Soule from thee, and then whoſe ſhall thoſe thinges be, which thou haſt prouided?</hi> Neither was this the caſe and condition of this man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but it is the caſe and condition of euery one that gathereth riches to himſelfe, and is not rich in God. This rich man is dead and gone: but hee hath left a plentifull of ſpring and a great generation behind him. Looke vpon mens liues, and ſee whether the cares of this life, be not the firſt in their thoughtes, purpoſes, prayers, and practiſes. Giue them enough of this world, and let him that will, take the world to come. All their ſtudy, all their toyling and moyling is for the red and white earth, that is, for Gold and Siluer, and other traſh of this world, as if they could neuer be full of it, as if they would neuer be weary of it, as if they ſhould neuer depart out of it. It is ſaide of <hi>Salomon</hi> Prou. 30 <note n="x" place="margin">Prou. 30. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>The Horſſe-leech hath two Daughters which cry, bring, bring,</hi> ſo is it with theſe worldly minded men, they can neuer be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, they alwaies cry out for more, they will not be content, they cannot ſay, they haue enough. It is a token of a brood baſely borne, that reſpecteth not the inheritance of ſonnes: ſo it is an euident ſigne that wee are not the ſonnes of God, when we minde not the Kingdome that the father hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for vs, and the ſonne hath purchaſed vnto vs. The Beaſtes were borne and faſhioned to looke downe-ward: man created after the Image of God, looketh vpward and beholdeth the Heauens. It is a great diſcord and iarre betweene the eye and the heart, which ſhould goe together: when the eye is caſt vpward, and the heart of man groweth downeward: the eye is fixed aboue, and the heart delighteth to be alwaies groueling vpon the ground, and glued vnto the earth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as this Doctrine meeteth with their corruption that haue their conuerſation below, in the center and bowels of the earth, <note n="y" place="margin">Phil. 3, 20.</note>

Our Sauiour, ſpeaking of the firſt Table of the Law, calleth it the firſt and great commandement: firſt, in dignity and order; in dignity, becauſe it comprehendeth and containeth the duties we owe to God: In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Nature, becauſe from the loue of God proceedeth the loue to our Neighbour, Likewiſe great, becauſe it is of greateſt waight and ſtretcheth
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:7222:265"/> fartheſt, and is chiefly to be reſpected of vs. Hence it is, that when an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounder of the law asked him a queſtion, <note n="z" place="margin">Math, 22, 36, 37, 38.</note> 
                  <hi>Maiſter, which is the greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement in the Law?</hi> He anſwered him, <hi>Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy ſoule, and with all thy minde, this is the firſt &amp; the great commandement.</hi> Theſe precepts are firſt commanded, but they are laſt practiſed and leaſt regarded. They are called of Chriſt, great: but they are very ſmall and little, in the eyes of the greateſt part and ſort of men. If they lead an honeſt and ciuill life before men, if they deale iuſtly and truely with their Neighbours, they thinke all is well, they eſteeme themſelues as perfect men, though they liue ignorantly, prophanely, and irreligiouſly, though they haue no knowledge of God and of his worde, though they regard not his worſhippe priuatelie or publikelie. If they can ſay, wee are no Theeues, or Murtherers, we are not defiled with Fornication, and Adultery, we pay euery man his owne, and do as we would be done vnto; they ſuppoſe they beare as good a Soule to God, as the beſt, and ſhall bee ſaued as ſoone as any. But aske them any thing of the worſhip of God, or marke what their practiſe is touching his worſhip, they haue no loue to it, they take no delight in it, their meditation is not vpon the word, their care is not to ſanctifie the Sabboath, and conſequently the duties which they perfourme toward men, haue no right ground to ſtand vpon, and therefore, though they may bring profit to others, yet can they miniſter no comfort to themſelues. The firſt Table is the heart of all Religion, and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation whereupon the duties of Righteouſneſſe are builded. If they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not from a religious reſpect to God, they are as an houſe ſet vpon the Sand, which wanteth a ſure ground-worke.</p>

True it is, wee are bounde and charged in duty to vſe the meanes that God hath appointed for vs, and to exerciſe our ſelues with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, labour, and induſtry in our callings; but we muſt not truſt in theſe meanes and put our confidence in them, and diſtruſt the care and prouidence of God toward vs. There is a double care for the thinges of this Life: there is a good and godly care, which is neceſſary for euery one; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary whereof, is to be careleſſe, idle, waſting, and ſpending vnthriſtily and wickedly, ſuch thinges as are gotten by our labour. This prouidence and fore-caſt is commended and commanded in many places of the Scripture. This the Apoſtle teacheth and ſpeaketh off, 1. Tim. 5. <note n="a" place="margin">1 Tim, 5, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>If there be any that prouideth not for his owne, and namely for them of his houſhold, he denyeth the faith, and is worſe then an Infidell.</hi> The other ſort of care, is a care ioyned with griefe and penſiueneſſe, and of this the Apoſtle ſaith, <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor, 7, 32.</note> 
                  <hi>I would haue you without care.</hi> This care is an ouer-great care, diſquieting the heart and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it bond to the vnrighteous <hi>Mammon;</hi> this is alwaies to be condemned, as that which breedeth in vs a diſtruſt in Gods prouidence, and choaketh the loue of heauenly thinges, and therefore is hurtfull and pernicious. This our Sauiour reproueth in the Goſpell according to <hi>Mathew,</hi> Chap. 6. <note n="c" place="margin">Math 6, 25.</note> 
                  <hi>I ſay vnto you, be not carefull for your life, what ye ſhall eate, or what ye ſhall drinke, nor yet for your Body what ye ſhall put on, &amp;c. Behold the Foules of the Heauen, for they neither ſow nor reape. Which of you by taking care, can adde one Cubite to his ſtature? And why care ye for Raiment? Behold how the Lillies of the field do grow, and yet they neither labour, nor ſpinne. Therefore take no thought what ye ſhall eate, or what ye ſhall drinke, or wherewith ye ſhall be cloathed, for your Heauenly Father knoweth that ye haue need of all theſe thinges, &amp;c.</hi> Wee haue the Lord to care for vs, who knoweth our wants, and the meanes how to ſupply them. He made all thinges before we had our being, to teach vs his prouidence. All the Mines of Siluer and Gold, that lye in the heart of
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:7222:266"/> the earth, are his, and at his commandement. Hence it is, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, Heb. 13, <note n="d" place="margin">Heb, 13, 5, 6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Haue your conuerſation without Coueteouſneſſe, and bee content with thoſe thinges that ye haue: for he hath ſaid, I will not faile thee, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forſake thee: ſo that we may boldly ſay, The Lord is mine helper, neither will I feare what man can do vnto me.</hi> Can we therefore doubt of his ſuccouring of vs, and the ſupplying of our wants? If we conſider his power, he is God: if his will, he is our Father. Will God forſake or forget his Creatures? Or can a father be vnmindfull or vnmercifull toward his Children? This were to make him no God, no Father, which is Blaſphemy and impiety. The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> hauing himſelfe had a long experience of Gods watchfull eye ouer him, teacheth vs alſo to depend vpon him, Pſal. 55. <note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 55, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Caſt thy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vpon the Lord, and he ſhall nouriſh thee: he will not ſuffer the righteous to fall for euer.</hi> It is great vanity to be ouergreedy and gaping after the tranſitory thinges of this world, to be carking and caring in the ſeeking for them, and to eate the bread of ſorrow in going about them. We ſhould vſe them, as though we vſed them not: and enioy them, as though we poſſeſſed them, not. To this purpoſe the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, Chap, 5. <note n="f" place="margin">1 Pet, 5, 7,</note> 
                  <hi>Caſt all your care on him, for he careth for you.</hi> Wherefore then ſhould we nouriſh immoderate and exceſſiue cares in our boſomes, ſeeing we haue aſſurance of Gods care to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs? Let vs truſt in him, and be ſecure without all diſtruſt and feare. If we haue ſpent our daies in the following and purſuing after the vaine profits of this life, let vs bethinke our ſelues what we haue done, and ſtudy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme the time that is to come, and conſider wherefore we were created &amp; redeemed. The things that are ſeene are temporall, the thinges that are not ſeene they are eternall. Let vs aboue all preferre thoſe thinges that are able beſt to preferre vs. Let vs not liue heere as men that ſpend all their daies in catching after feathers, and following toyes and trifles that cannot profit. If we ſhould ſee a man waſt his yeares, from day to day, and from moneth to moneth, and from yeare to yeare, and hauing liued forty or fifty yeares hath done nothing but catch after ſhadowes, runne after Butter-Flies, follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gew-gawes, or behold the Moone-ſhine in the waters, or alwayes looke downe vpon the earth, or alwayes blowe vp Feathers in the Aire: would we not thinke him ſtarke mad, and iudge him out of his wittes? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man is ready to accuſe him of Madneſſe, no man would thinke he did him wrong to call him ſo, or craue pardon for that he hath done. But bee not too haſtye to cenſure ſuch, and to paſſe the ſentence of Madneſſe vpon them, leaſt the Parable be applied to thy ſelfe, and be verified of thy ſelfe.

                  <hi>Vanity of vanities, ſaith the Preacher, Vanity of Vanities, all is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>anity.</hi> If then theſe things be all vaine, nay; Vanity it ſelfe: it is more then certaine that ſuch as ſpend their time, and waſt their years, and conſume their ſtrength in catching after theſe toyes, theſe ſhaddowes, theſe ſhewes, theſe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, theſe follies, theſe triſles, and ſpend more yeares in purſuing after theſe earthly thinges, then they do houres in attaining Heauenly thinges, may truely be accounted Fooles, or Mad-men, or ſottiſh, or ſuch as are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with a Spirit of giddineſſe, that runne vp and downe hither and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and know not what they do.</p>

Who is ſo ſimple that doth not vnderſtand, that the ſoule is more noble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then the body? If then it be more worthy as being a ſpirit, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall ſpirit: ought we not in the firſt place to prouide for it? Ought wee not to adorne it with all ſpirituall graces? Ought we not ſo to quallifie it, as that it may be inheritour of eternall glory? Let vs therefore affect the things of certaine abode, and ſeeke after Wiſedome, Faith, Sanctification, and the true Riches of the Spirit. If our Treaſure be in Heauen, our hearts will be there alſo.</p>
               <p>Let vs lay vp and locke vp our Treaſure in Immortality: let vs be ſure to lay a good foundation againſt the time to come. One thing is neceſſary, this is the good part that ſhall not bee taken away from vs. All humaine thinges are full of vncertainties, and the meanes of their decaying and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing are manifold, the Ruſt, the Moth, the Canker, the Theefe, beſide a thouſand other caſualties that take them away from vs. It is an holy and heauenly admonition giuen vnto vs by Chriſt, Math, 6. <note n="i" place="margin">Math, 6, 33.</note> 
                  <hi>Firſt ſeeke the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God and his Righteouſneſſe, and then all other thinges ſhall be miniſtred vnto you.</hi> This checketh and controlleth the prepoſterous order and bad practiſe of moſt men in their callinges, they ſet the wrong end forward, they labour firſt of all to get wealth and wellfare from day to day, and from yeare to yeare, but neuer thinke of the roote of welfare, and from what Fountain all earthly bleſſings ſpring, to wit; from the grace of God. Let vs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our paines to get Gods fauour, and then tranſitory thinges, Wealth, Peace, Honour, Liberty, and ſuch like will follow, ſo farre as they ſhall bee expedient for vs: otherwiſe, all our abundance ſhall turne to be our bane, woe, and deſtruction, all thinges ſhall be accurſed vnto vs, our Table ſhall be made a ſnare to take vs and torment vs. The grace of God in Chriſt is ſufficient to make a man bleſſed: and without it, all other thinges (though we had them in the greateſt meaſure) cannot free vs from curſednes. Now it is vnpoſſible that euer we ſhuld ſeeke for theſe gratious gifts of God, except we feele our own miſery in the want of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It is the want of health which we deſire to haue reſtored, &amp; the feeling of our diſeaſe which we deſire to haue remoued, that driueth vs to the Phiſitian. And we haue no promiſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:7222:267"/> earthly thinges, except we ſeeke them as we ought to ſeeke them, and follow the right manner that God hath left vnto vs to find them. Many ſeeke after them, and pray for them; but they do not obtaine, becauſe they aske amiſſe. It is our duty, not onely to pray for lawfull thinges, but alſo in a lawfull manner. A man may do a good thing after an euill manner: it is in our actions, ſo it may be in our prayers. An indirect and vnſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied order, may marre and corrupt a good and godly prayer. To conclude therefore, let vs know, that this grace and fauour of God ſo often remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred in <hi>Paules</hi> Epiſtles, and ſo often craued and prayed for, to be beſtowed vpon the Saints, is onely able to giue ſatisfaction and contentment vnto the ſoule to ſtay and reſt vpon, and therefore we ought aboue all other thinges to labour earneſtly to feele it in our hearts. Indeed, it ſeemeth nothing and baſe in his eyes that hath it not: but when a man once knoweth the worth and value of it, and taſteth the ſweet comforts of it within him, he is ready to ſell all that he hath to enioy it and retaine it, he is content to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and forſake all Dignity and Honour, all Glory and Praiſe, all Health and Beauty, all Friends and Fauour, all Wealth and Treaſure, all Ioy and Delight, all Mirth and Melody, yea; Brethren and Siſters, and Lands, and Wife, and Children, and all thinges that may be deare vnto him, rather then depart from this Iewell of grace, farre in price aboue all the Iewels of this World. It is with vs in reſpect of ſpirituall thinges, as it fareth with the buyer, while he is in buying his commodity before he is poſſeſſed of it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diſcription of <hi>Salomon,</hi> Prou. 20. <note n="i" place="margin">Prou, 20, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>It is naught, it is naught, ſaith the buyer: but when he is gone apart, he boaſteth.</hi> He diminiſheth the goodneſſe of it, he ſaith it is to much, it is not worth the money you aske for it, but when he hath purchaſed and poſſeſſeth it, he praiſeth his penni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths, and iudgeth it better then his money. So is it with all Heauenly graces, ſo long as we are deſtitute of them, we thinke them not worth our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and trauel, &amp; ſeeking, and enioying, we eſteem euery houre too much, that is ſpent in following the meanes appointed to obtaine them, and albeit God call vnto vs <note n="k" place="margin">Eſay, 55, 1, 2.</note>

But when once we haue found the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and know the iuſt price and value of them, we would not looſe them for all the World, nor for a thouſand worldes if they were offered vnto vs: nay we are willing to ſell all we haue, to haue them continue and abide with vs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the counſell of the ſame <hi>Salomon,</hi> Prou. 23, 23. <note n="l" place="margin">Prou, 23, 23.</note>

Let vs do that now which wee would do at the laſt gaſpe and breath. Then we are ready to renounce the World, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre one drop of grace and faith before a Kingdome. Let vs now begin to learne wiſedome, let vs proſtrate our ſelues before the Throne of grace, let vs neuer giue reſt to our ſoules vntill we find it, and let vs ſue vnto him that is the Author and Fountaine of all grace, to wit; Chriſt Ieſus, to whom with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt be all glory and praiſe for euer, Amen.</p>
